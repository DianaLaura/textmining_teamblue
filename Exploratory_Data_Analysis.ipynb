&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T&lt;span&gt;hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=right&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. &lt;/span&gt;More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W&lt;span&gt;hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. &lt;span&gt;You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969. (Flickr/&lt;a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294438012/&gt;FastLizard4&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first open financial network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin network serves the same purpose as mainstream payment networks such as Visa or Western Union. But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with &lt;a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf&gt;hundreds of pages&lt;/a&gt; of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Finding Bitcoin's killer app&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=left&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;People have been &lt;a target=_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world&gt;building Bitcoin ATMs&lt;/a&gt; to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are &lt;a target=_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/&gt;329 of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;&lt;a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;&gt;401(K) 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what &lt;a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590&gt;happened to Paypal&lt;/a&gt; 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;</td></tr>\n",

exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There's a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat — and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine. But the evidence remains quite limited, largely as a result of prohibition and strict federal oversight of medical research.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it, says Sue Sisley, a doctor and researcher at the University of Arizona. It is negligent for these 20 states to go selling cards to marijuana patients without actively conducting rigorous medical marijuana research that's necessary.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=center&gt;Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Sisley wants to study marijuana as a treatment for military veterans with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), but it took until March — &lt;a href=http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/timeline/&gt;nearly four years after the study's conception&lt;/a&gt; — for the study to get federal approval. First, she needed the Food and Drug Administration to sign off. Then, her team waited three years for approval from the Public Health Service to obtain legal marijuana supplies. &lt;span&gt;(No other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ds.shtml&gt;schedule 1 drug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;needs the extra round of approval,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.maps.org/media/view/press_release_public_health_service_blocks_fda-approved_medical_mariju/&gt;according to Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It's a long process, Sisley says. And we believe the only reason we got the Public Health Service approval, finally, was because of really strong advocacy from our veterans all over the country who were asking the federal government why they were blocking this research.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the difficulties, some marijuana research managed to get approval in the United States and other countries over the past few years. And the findings so far suggest a drug that holds the potential to treat some medical problems better than traditional medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4243637/482681757.jpg class=photo alt=482681757&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could relieve foot pain. Anadolu Agency&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Among the most obvious medical qualities of marijuana is its use as a painkiller. At least &lt;a href=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/182/14/E694.abstract&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=https://www.neurology.org/content/68/7/515.abstract&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; found marijuana can successfully treat different kinds of pain, including a difficult-to-treat kind called neuropathic pain and pain among HIV/AIDS patients.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The major advantage to marijuana as a painkiller is it could reduce reliance on more addictive, dangerous opiates. One study &lt;a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering &lt;a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills&gt;how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse&lt;/a&gt;, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Nausea and loss of appetite&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266_1_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266_1_&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Everyone loves pizza. Tim Boyle / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Marijuana users are likely familiar with the munchies, a strong desire to eat while under the influence. It should come as little surprise, then, that marijuana is a great way to treat nausea and loss of appetite, &lt;a href=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/IOM_Report.pdf&gt;according to the Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Treating these symptoms can play a pivotal role in recovering from a serious illness. Cancer patients, for example, often experience nausea and loss of appetite — and, as a result, rapid weight lost — during chemotherapy treatments. Getting these patients to eat healthy could speed up their recoveries, making it &lt;a href=http://www.webmd.com/cancer/features/eating-treatment&gt;a major interest&lt;/a&gt; among health experts.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242733/144995835_1_.jpg class=photo alt=144995835_1_&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could let you sleep like this red panda. Mark Ralston / AFP&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is a disorder that leads to shaking and difficulty with movement. It also often leads to pain and &lt;a href=http://www.everydayhealth.com/parkinsons-disease/sleeping-well-with-parkinsons-disease.aspx&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01278.x/abstract&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; concluded marijuana's psychoactive properties could be particularly suited to treat Parkinson's. &lt;a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614667&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found marijuana significantly improved pain and sleep issues among Parkinson's patients. Both studies advised more research, but their initial results were noted as positive.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242773/179789883.jpg class=photo alt=179789883&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could make this pain go away. BSIP / Universal Images Group&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — not to be mixed up with irritable bowel syndrome — is a painful, potentially life-threatening illness that involves chronic inflammation of a person's digestive tract. Crohn's disease is a severe form of IBD that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;IBD and Crohn's disease currently have no cure. Instead, &lt;a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage&gt;current treatments&lt;/a&gt; focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in &lt;a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512&gt;an extensive review&lt;/a&gt; of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;PTSD&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after moments of extreme emotional trauma. It's a well-recognized problem among military veterans, with no adequate pharmaceutical treatments.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Except perhaps marijuana. &lt;a href=http://communications.med.nyu.edu/media-relations/news/brain-imaging-study-links-cannabinoid-receptors-post-traumatic-stress-disorder&gt;A brain-imaging study&lt;/a&gt; concluded that marijuana's chemical properties seem particularly poised for addressing PTSD.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;&lt;span class=s2&gt;There’s a consensus among clinicians  that existing pharmaceutical treatments such as antidepressants simply  do not work, Alexander Neumeister, the study’s lead researcher, said in  a statement. In fact, we know very well that people with PTSD who use  marijuana — a potent cannabinoid — often experience more relief from  their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric  medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;It should come as little surprise, then, that the first person to buy recreational marijuana in Colorado was &lt;span class=s2&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-101660.html&gt;Sean Azzariti&lt;/a&gt;, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD. (Colorado law currently forbids treating PTSD with medical marijuana.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;Azzariti's example speaks to one problem often raised by supporters of medical marijuana: sometimes allowing marijuana for medical purposes isn't enough; it's important for advocates to push states to expand the drug's medical availability.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Epilepsy and seizures&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242877/698723.jpg class=photo alt=698723&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Researchers would like to give medical marijuana a deeper look. Michel Porro / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Although the scientific evidence is scarce, the Epilepsy Foundation &lt;a href=http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2014/2/epilepsy-foundation-calls-increased-medical-marijuana-access-and-research&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that medical marijuana should be opened up to patients with epilepsy and uncontrollable seizures.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;With medical marijuana spreading across the states, stories have trickled out claiming that marijuana helped solve people's struggles with epilepsy and seizures. A cancer patient, for example, &lt;a href=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-27741-healthy_hits.html&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; last year that taking marijuana eased her epilepsy, on top of her nausea and loss of appetite.&lt;span class=s2&gt; Without medical marijuana, I wouldn’t be alive today, she said. It really has changed my life for the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions. While this list is limited to six examples, it could certainly grow as legalization encourages doctors and researchers to take another look at a drug once marked as taboo.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td></tr>\n",

Century&lt;/i&gt; advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. &lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century&gt;You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book&lt;/a&gt;. But the argument &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;is built&lt;/span&gt; upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;tells&lt;/span&gt; many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;1) The fall and rise of Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png class=photo alt=World_output&gt;300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;2) The return of inequality in Britain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_britain&gt;This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;wealth&lt;/span&gt; was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;3) The return of inequality in Germany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_germany&gt;The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;Instead wealth&lt;/span&gt; was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;4) America's age of equality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_the_united_states&gt;American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt; \\n&lt;div id=slaves&gt;&lt;span&gt;5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \\n&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United_states_with_slavery&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;6) The varieties of capitalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png class=photo alt=Market_value_and_book_value&gt;This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;7) The really really rich are different from you and me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png class=photo alt=Income_composition&gt;This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;8) Wealth is much more unequal than income&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth_inequality&gt;You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;much &lt;/i&gt;more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;9) The billionaires boom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td></tr>\n",

legalized recreational marijuana sales, Denver embraced the opportunity with open arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The city is now home to more than 62 percent of all Colorado recreational marijuana retailers, who cashed in on &lt;a href=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/colorado-marijuana-tax-revenue_n_4936223.html&gt;$14 million in sales&lt;/a&gt; in January alone.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other cities weren't so eager: heeding legalization opponents'  safety concerns, several pushed off licensing retail sales. Some banned  retail sales altogether.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There will be many harmful   consequences, Douglas County Sheriff David Weaver warned in a September 2012 statement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expect more  crime, more kids using marijuana, and pot for sale  everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=center&gt;Thugs put on masks, they come to your house, they kick in your door. They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana, give me your money.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;One California sheriff &lt;a href=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/02/11/sheriff-in-california-says-coloradans-will-regret-legalizing-marijuana/&gt;went on Denver television&lt;/a&gt; to warn that, as a result of marijuana in his county, thugs put on masks, they come to your house, they kick  in your door. They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana,  give me your money.'&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three months into its legalization experiment, Denver isn't seeing a  widespread rise in crime. Violent and property crimes actually decreased  slightly, and some cities are taking a second look at allowing  marijuana sales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We had folks, kind of doomsayers, saying, 'Oh my gosh, we're going  to have riots in the streets the day they open,' Denver City Council  President Mary Beth Susman, a supporter of legal marijuana, says. But  it was so quiet.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Denver's violent crime rate is holding steady&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=Violent_crime_in_denver class=photo src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262311/violent_crime_in_denver.png&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;/center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Denver's &lt;a href=http://www.denvergov.org/police/PoliceDepartment/CrimeInformation/CrimeStatisticsMaps/tabid/441370/Default.aspx&gt;crime data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows a slight decrease in the past year: violent crime in January and February fell by 2.4 percent compared to the first two months of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Property crime is falling, too&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262319/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_1.50.37_PM__1_.png class=photo alt=Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_1&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;/center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to legalization, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23763821/denver-das-version-violent-medical-marijuana-industry-questioned&gt;opponents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b style=line-height: 1.5;&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;warned  property crime would rise. Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Three months is still a short time frame&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Gorman, director of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, &lt;a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. &lt;a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and &lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana&gt;medical marijuana&lt;/a&gt; legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, &lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana&gt;issued guidances&lt;/a&gt; telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks &lt;a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx&gt;remain skeptical&lt;/a&gt; without changes in the law itself.)&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. &lt;a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Some cities aren't resisting this offer. Chris Hondros / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After Denver's smooth transition, other major cities in Colorado now  appear ready to join. Aurora, the third most populous city in Colorado, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://kdvr.com/2014/03/26/aurora-to-enter-retail-marijuana-foray/&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to open recreational sales in October, even though medical sales remain  illegal through voter rule. And Fort Collins, the fourth most populous  city in the state, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20140318/NEWS01/303180076/Fort-Collins-council-gives-final-go-ahead-recreational-pot-stores&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to have applications ready for recreational dispensaries in early April.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;If Denver's experience holds true, the transition — at least for the first few months — should go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </span></td></tr>\n",

sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a &lt;a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/&gt;prediction&lt;/a&gt; that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But &lt;a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/&gt;not one of them&lt;/a&gt; had given up.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obamacare's March madness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the &lt;i&gt;entire &lt;/i&gt;month of October.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. &lt;span&gt;California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector_enrollment.png alt=Connector_enrollment&gt;&lt;span&gt;But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h4&gt;Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance&lt;/h4&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p dir=ltr&gt;&lt;span&gt;On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p dir=ltr&gt;But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p dir=ltr&gt;That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says.

                               </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>&lt;p&gt;For the past six months, the best Obamacare sign-up data hasn't come from a Washington think-tank or Health and Human Services number-crunchers.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The best, most granular accounting of Obamacare's sign-ups happens in a messy bedroom-turned-office in Michigan where Charles Gaba runs&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/&gt;ACASignups.Net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=center&gt;Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba is a 43-year-old web developer who lives in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=Charles_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Charles Gaba&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as &lt;a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/&gt;the invaluable Charles Gaba&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png class=photo alt=State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions&gt;&lt;br id=1396567685947&gt; It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law &amp;mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=right&gt;Most people who tried to track enrollment &amp;mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &amp;mdash; gave up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Most people who tried to track enrollment &amp;mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &amp;mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day &amp;mdash; one before work, one after &amp;mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;'&lt;span&gt;For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'&lt;/span&gt;\\n&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups &amp;mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors &amp;mdash; announced prominently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=left&gt;I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;div&gt;Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. &lt;span&gt;The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. &lt;/span&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt; \\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In January, Gaba &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;&gt;projected &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I'm getting a little nervous.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers &amp;mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March &amp;mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on. I think, hopefully, the site will have served its function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td></tr>\n",

kind to<span> </span><a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;>Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly \\$1,000 in January before falling to around \\$350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=right><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969.

But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf>hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=left><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>People have been <a target=\\_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world>building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target=\\_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/>329 of them</a>.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323\\_4c41d3ef76\\_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323\\_4c41d3ef76\\_b></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;>401(K) 2013</a></p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590>happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p>\\\\\n",

At least <a href=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/182/14/E694.abstract>two</a> <a href=https://www.neurology.org/content/68/7/515.abstract>studies</a> found marijuana can successfully treat different kinds of pain, including a difficult-to-treat kind called neuropathic pain and pain among HIV/AIDS patients.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The major advantage to marijuana as a painkiller is it could reduce reliance on more addictive, dangerous opiates. One study <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225>concluded</a> that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering <a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills>how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse</a>, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Nausea and loss of appetite</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266\\_1\\_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266\\_1\\_></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Everyone loves pizza.

Instead, <a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage>current treatments</a> focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372>a recent study</a> found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in <a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512>an extensive review</a> of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>PTSD</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD.

It really has changed my life for the better.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions.

advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century>You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World\\_Output.png class=photo alt=World\\_output>300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital\\_in\\_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital\\_in\\_britain>This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital\\_in\\_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital\\_in\\_germany>The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States.png class=photo alt=Capital\\_in\\_the\\_united\\_states>American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3> \\textbackslash{}n<div id=slaves><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \\textbackslash{}n</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United\\_States\\_With\\_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United\\_states\\_with\\_slavery></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market\\_value\\_and\\_book\\_value.png class=photo alt=Market\\_value\\_and\\_book\\_value>This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income\\_composition.png class=photo alt=Income\\_composition>This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth\\_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth\\_inequality>You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span> </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/>told CNN</a> that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info\\%3Adoi\\%2F10.1371\\%2Fjournal.pone.0092816>One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana>medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana>issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx>remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996>One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get \\$20 to \\$100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get \\$30,000 in cash.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>A grow operation will have a \\$20,000 or \\$30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  \\$20,000 or \\$30,000 in a briefcase.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Some cities aren't resisting this offer.

Obamacare hit 8 million sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.</q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/>prediction</a> that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/>not one of them</a> had given up.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><br>People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>Obamacare's March madness</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the <i>entire </i>month of October.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. <span>California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q>15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.</q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector\\_enrollment.png alt=Connector\\_enrollment><span>But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h4>Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance</h4> \\textbackslash{}n<p>There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p dir=ltr><span>On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p dir=ltr>But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p dir=ltr>That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says. But that they would stick through so much hassle still amazes us.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

\\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba is a 43-year-old web developer who lives in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img alt=Charles\\_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles\\_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Charles Gaba</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as <a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/>the invaluable Charles Gaba</a>.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. </span><span>Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.</span><span> Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state\\_health\\_insurance\\_exchange\\_decisions.png class=photo alt=State\\_health\\_insurance\\_exchange\\_decisions><br id=1396567685947> It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law \\&mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=right>Most people who tried to track enrollment \\&mdash; and weren't doing it for a living \\&mdash; gave up</q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Most people who tried to track enrollment \\&mdash; and weren't doing it for a living \\&mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day \\&mdash; one before work, one after \\&mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>'<span>For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'</span>\\textbackslash{}n</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from\\&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k>South Carolina</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k>New York</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts>Maryland</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension>Nevada</a><span>, </span><span>and </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers>California</a><span>. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups \\&mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors \\&mdash; announced prominently.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=left>I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going </q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<div>Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. <span>The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. </span>\\textbackslash{}n</div> \\textbackslash{}n<div><br></div> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>In January, Gaba </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: \\#ffffff; line-height: 1.5;>projected </a><span>that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>'I'm getting a little nervous.'</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers \\&mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. </span><span>I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March \\&mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on.

markets haven't been kind to<span> </span><a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;>Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \\n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \\n<p><q class=right><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \\n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \\n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \\n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \\n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp></p> \\n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \\n<p class=caption>This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969.

But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \\n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf>hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \\n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \\n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \\n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \\n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \\n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \\n<p><q class=left><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \\n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \\n<p>People have been <a target=_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world>building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target=_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/>329 of them</a>.</p> \\n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \\n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.</p> \\n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \\n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \\n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b></p> \\n<p class=caption><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;>401(K) 2013</a></p> \\n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \\n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \\n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \\n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \\n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \\n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \\n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590>happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \\n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \\n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \\n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p> | \n",

<p>Twenty states have so far legalized the medical use of marijuana, and researchers are starting to look at how, exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.</p> \\n<p>There's a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat — and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine. But the evidence remains quite limited, largely as a result of prohibition and strict federal oversight of medical research.</p> \\n<p>Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it, says Sue Sisley, a doctor and researcher at the University of Arizona. It is negligent for these 20 states to go selling cards to marijuana patients without actively conducting rigorous medical marijuana research that's necessary.</p> \\n<p><q class=center>Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it</q></p> \\n<p>Sisley wants to study marijuana as a treatment for military veterans with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), but it took until March — <a href=http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/timeline/>nearly four years after the study's conception</a> — for the study to get federal approval. First, she needed the Food and Drug Administration to sign off. Then, her team waited three years for approval from the Public Health Service to obtain legal marijuana supplies. <span>(No other </span><a href=http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ds.shtml>schedule 1 drug</a><span> </span><span>needs the extra round of approval,</span><span> </span><a href=http://www.maps.org/media/view/press_release_public_health_service_blocks_fda-approved_medical_mariju/>according to Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a><span>.)</span></p> \\n<p>It's a long process, Sisley says. And we believe the only reason we got the Public Health Service approval, finally, was because of really strong advocacy from our veterans all over the country who were asking the federal government why they were blocking this research.</p> \\n<p><span></span><span>Despite the difficulties, some marijuana research managed to get approval in the United States and other countries over the past few years.

Anadolu Agency</p> \\n<p>Among the most obvious medical qualities of marijuana is its use as a painkiller. At least <a href=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/182/14/E694.abstract>two</a> <a href=https://www.neurology.org/content/68/7/515.abstract>studies</a> found marijuana can successfully treat different kinds of pain, including a difficult-to-treat kind called neuropathic pain and pain among HIV/AIDS patients.</p> \\n<p>The major advantage to marijuana as a painkiller is it could reduce reliance on more addictive, dangerous opiates. One study <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225>concluded</a> that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering <a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills>how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse</a>, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.</p> \\n<h3>Nausea and loss of appetite</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266_1_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266_1_></p> \\n<p class=caption>Everyone loves pizza. Tim Boyle / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Marijuana users are likely familiar with the munchies, a strong desire to eat while under the influence. It should come as little surprise, then, that marijuana is a great way to treat nausea and loss of appetite, <a href=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/IOM_Report.pdf>according to the Institute of Medicine</a>.</p> \\n<p>Treating these symptoms can play a pivotal role in recovering from a serious illness. Cancer patients, for example, often experience nausea and loss of appetite — and, as a result, rapid weight lost — during chemotherapy treatments. Getting these patients to eat healthy could speed up their recoveries, making it <a href=http://www.webmd.com/cancer/features/eating-treatment>a major interest</a> among health experts.</p> \\n<h3>Parkinson's disease</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242733/144995835_1_.jpg class=photo alt=144995835_1_></p> \\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could let you sleep like this red panda. Mark Ralston / AFP</p> \\n<p>Parkinson's disease is a disorder that leads to shaking and difficulty with movement. It also often leads to pain and <a href=http://www.everydayhealth.com/parkinsons-disease/sleeping-well-with-parkinsons-disease.aspx>sleep deprivation</a>.</p> \\n<p><a href=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01278.x/abstract>One study</a> concluded marijuana's psychoactive properties could be particularly suited to treat Parkinson's. <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614667>Another study</a> found marijuana significantly improved pain and sleep issues among Parkinson's patients. Both studies advised more research, but their initial results were noted as positive.</p> \\n<h3>Inflammatory bowel disease</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242773/179789883.jpg class=photo alt=179789883></p> \\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could make this pain go away. BSIP / Universal Images Group</p> \\n<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — not to be mixed up with irritable bowel syndrome — is a painful, potentially life-threatening illness that involves chronic inflammation of a person's digestive tract. Crohn's disease is a severe form of IBD that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and malnutrition.</p> \\n<p>IBD and Crohn's disease currently have no cure. Instead, <a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage>current treatments</a> focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.</p> \\n<p>But <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372>a recent study</a> found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in <a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512>an extensive review</a> of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.</p> \\n<h3>PTSD</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241></p> \\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after moments of extreme emotional trauma. It's a well-recognized problem among military veterans, with no adequate pharmaceutical treatments.</p> \\n<p>Except perhaps marijuana. <a href=http://communications.med.nyu.edu/media-relations/news/brain-imaging-study-links-cannabinoid-receptors-post-traumatic-stress-disorder>A brain-imaging study</a> concluded that marijuana's chemical properties seem particularly poised for addressing PTSD.</p> \\n<p class=p3><span class=s2>There’s a consensus among clinicians  that existing pharmaceutical treatments such as antidepressants simply  do not work, Alexander Neumeister, the study’s lead researcher, said in  a statement. In fact, we know very well that people with PTSD who use  marijuana — a potent cannabinoid — often experience more relief from  their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric  medications.</span></p> \\n<p class=p3>It should come as little surprise, then, that the first person to buy recreational marijuana in Colorado was <span class=s2><a href=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-101660.html>Sean Azzariti</a>, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD. (Colorado law currently forbids treating PTSD with medical marijuana.)</span></p> \\n<p class=p3>Azzariti's example speaks to one problem often raised by supporters of medical marijuana: sometimes allowing marijuana for medical purposes isn't enough; it's important for advocates to push states to expand the drug's medical availability.</p> \\n<h3>Epilepsy and seizures</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242877/698723.jpg class=photo alt=698723></p> \\n<p class=caption>Researchers would like to give medical marijuana a deeper look. Michel Porro / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Although the scientific evidence is scarce, the Epilepsy Foundation <a href=http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2014/2/epilepsy-foundation-calls-increased-medical-marijuana-access-and-research>argues</a> that medical marijuana should be opened up to patients with epilepsy and uncontrollable seizures.</p> \\n<p class=p3>With medical marijuana spreading across the states, stories have trickled out claiming that marijuana helped solve people's struggles with epilepsy and seizures. A cancer patient, for example, <a href=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-27741-healthy_hits.html>told me</a> last year that taking marijuana eased her epilepsy, on top of her nausea and loss of appetite.<span class=s2> Without medical marijuana, I wouldn’t be alive today, she said. It really has changed my life for the better.</span></p> \\n<p>Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.</p> \\n<p>The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions. While this list is limited to six examples, it could certainly grow as legalization encourages doctors and researchers to take another look at a drug once marked as taboo.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \n",

Piketty's book <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i> advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century>You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \\n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png class=photo alt=World_output>300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \\n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_britain>This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \\n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_germany>The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \\n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_the_united_states>American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \\n<h3> \\n<div id=slaves><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \\n</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United_states_with_slavery></p> \\n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \\n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png class=photo alt=Market_value_and_book_value>This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \\n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png class=photo alt=Income_composition>This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \\n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth_inequality>You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \\n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires></p> \\n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | \n",

They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana,  give me your money.'</p> \\n<p><span>Three months into its legalization experiment, Denver isn't seeing a  widespread rise in crime. Violent and property crimes actually decreased  slightly, and some cities are taking a second look at allowing  marijuana sales.</span></p> \\n<p>We had folks, kind of doomsayers, saying, 'Oh my gosh, we're going  to have riots in the streets the day they open,' Denver City Council  President Mary Beth Susman, a supporter of legal marijuana, says. But  it was so quiet.</p> \\n<h3>Denver's violent crime rate is holding steady</h3> \\n<center> \\n<p><img alt=Violent_crime_in_denver class=photo src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262311/violent_crime_in_denver.png></p> \\n</center> \\n<p>Denver's <a href=http://www.denvergov.org/police/PoliceDepartment/CrimeInformation/CrimeStatisticsMaps/tabid/441370/Default.aspx>crime data</a><span> shows a slight decrease in the past year: violent crime in January and February fell by 2.4 percent compared to the first two months of 2013.</span></p> \\n<h3>Property crime is falling, too</h3> \\n<center> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262319/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_1.50.37_PM__1_.png class=photo alt=Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_1></p> \\n</center> \\n<p><span>Prior to legalization, </span><a href=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23763821/denver-das-version-violent-medical-marijuana-industry-questioned>opponents</a><b style=line-height: 1.5;> </b><span>warned  property crime would rise. Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). </span></p> \\n<p>So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \\n<p>Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \\n<p>Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.</p> \\n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \\n<p><span> </span></p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349></p> \\n<p class=caption>Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \\n<p>We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.</p> \\n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \\n<p>This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.</p> \\n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/>told CNN</a> that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.</p> \\n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962></p> \\n<p class=caption>Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816>One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana>medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \\n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.</p> \\n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.</p> \\n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \\n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883></p> \\n<p class=caption>People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \\n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana>issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx>remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \\n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996>One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \\n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash.</p> \\n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \\n<p>A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase.</p> \\n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840></p> \\n<p class=caption>Some cities aren't resisting this offer.

simple reason that Obamacare hit 8 million sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.</p> \\n<p>But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.</p> \\n<p><q>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.</q></p> \\n<p>Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/>prediction</a> that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/>not one of them</a> had given up.</p> \\n<p>I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.</p> \\n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \\n<p>If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.</p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment></p> \\n<p><br>People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.</p> \\n<h3><span>Obamacare's March madness</span></h3> \\n<p>Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the <i>entire </i>month of October.</p> \\n<p><span>Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.</span></p> \\n<p>The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. <span>California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. </span></p> \\n<p><q>15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.</q></p> \\n<p>For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.</p> \\n<p><span>This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.</span></p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector_enrollment.png alt=Connector_enrollment><span>But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.</span></p> \\n<p>It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.</p> \\n<h4>Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance</h4> \\n<p>There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.</p> \\n<p>We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.</p> \\n<p>They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.</p> \\n<p><span>The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.</span></p> \\n<p dir=ltr><span>On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.</span></p> \\n<p dir=ltr>But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.</p> \\n<p dir=ltr>That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says. But that they would stick through so much hassle still amazes us.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | \n",

past six months, the best Obamacare sign-up data hasn't come from a Washington think-tank or Health and Human Services number-crunchers.</p> \\n<p>The best, most granular accounting of Obamacare's sign-ups happens in a messy bedroom-turned-office in Michigan where Charles Gaba runs&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/>ACASignups.Net</a>.</p> \\n<p><q class=center>Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data</q></p> \\n<p>Gaba is a 43-year-old web developer who lives in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.</p> \\n<p><img alt=Charles_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center></p> \\n<p class=caption>Charles Gaba</p> \\n<p><span>But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.</span></p> \\n<p>Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as <a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/>the invaluable Charles Gaba</a>.</p> \\n<p><span>Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. </span><span>Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.</span><span> Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.</span></p> \\n<p>At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.</p> \\n<h3>'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png class=photo alt=State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions><br id=1396567685947> It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law &mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.</p> \\n<p>Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.</p> \\n<p>But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.</p> \\n<p><q class=right>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up</q></p> \\n<p><span>The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.</span></p> \\n<p>Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.</p> \\n<p>We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.</p> \\n<p>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.</p> \\n<p>You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day &mdash; one before work, one after &mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.</p> \\n<p>At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.</p> \\n<h3>'<span>For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'</span>\\n</h3> \\n<p>There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k>South Carolina</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k>New York</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts>Maryland</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension>Nevada</a><span>, </span><span>and </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers>California</a><span>. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. </span></p> \\n<p>The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.</p> \\n<p><span>The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups &mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors &mdash; announced prominently.</span></p> \\n<p><q class=left>I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going </q></p> \\n<p>The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.</p> \\n<p>It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.</p> \\n<div>Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. <span>The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. </span>\\n</div> \\n<div><br></div> \\n<p><span>In January, Gaba </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;>projected </a><span>that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.</span></p> \\n<p>For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.</p> \\n<p>This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.</p> \\n<h3><span>'I'm getting a little nervous.'</span></h3> \\n<p>Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers &mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.</p> \\n<p><span>My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. </span><span>I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.</span></p> \\n<p>We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).</p> \\n<p>I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.</p> \\n<p>Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March &mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.</p> \\n<p><span>It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on. I think, hopefully, the site will have served its function.</span></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \n",

       "1 <p>The markets haven't been kind to<span> </span><a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;>Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \\\\n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \\\\n<p><q class=right><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \\\\n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \\\\n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \\\\n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp></p> \\\\n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969. (Flickr/<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294438012/>FastLizard4</a>)</p> \\\\n<p><span></span></p> \\\\n<h3><span>The first open financial network</span></h3> \\\\n<p>The Bitcoin network serves the same purpose as mainstream payment networks such as Visa or Western Union. But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \\\\n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf>hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \\\\n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \\\\n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \\\\n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \\\\n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \\\\n<p><q class=left><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \\\\n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \\\\n<p>People have been <a target=_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world>building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target=_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/>329 of them</a>.</p> \\\\n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \\\\n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \\\\n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \\\\n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b></p> \\\\n<p class=caption><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;>401(K) 2013</a></p> \\\\n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \\\\n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \\\\n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \\\\n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \\\\n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590>happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \\\\n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p>\n",
       "2 <p>Twenty states have so far legalized the medical use of marijuana, and researchers are starting to look at how, exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.</p> \\\\n<p>There's a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat — and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine. But the evidence remains quite limited, largely as a result of prohibition and strict federal oversight of medical research.</p> \\\\n<p>Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it, says Sue Sisley, a doctor and researcher at the University of Arizona.

One study <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225>concluded</a> that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering <a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills>how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse</a>, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.</p> \\\\n<h3>Nausea and loss of appetite</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266_1_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266_1_></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Everyone loves pizza.

Instead, <a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage>current treatments</a> focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.</p> \\\\n<p>But <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372>a recent study</a> found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in <a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512>an extensive review</a> of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.</p> \\\\n<h3>PTSD</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after moments of extreme emotional trauma. It's a well-recognized problem among military veterans, with no adequate pharmaceutical treatments.</p> \\\\n<p>Except perhaps marijuana. <a href=http://communications.med.nyu.edu/media-relations/news/brain-imaging-study-links-cannabinoid-receptors-post-traumatic-stress-disorder>A brain-imaging study</a> concluded that marijuana's chemical properties seem particularly poised for addressing PTSD.</p> \\\\n<p class=p3><span class=s2>There’s a consensus among clinicians  that existing pharmaceutical treatments such as antidepressants simply  do not work, Alexander Neumeister, the study’s lead researcher, said in  a statement. In fact, we know very well that people with PTSD who use  marijuana — a potent cannabinoid — often experience more relief from  their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric  medications.</span></p> \\\\n<p class=p3>It should come as little surprise, then, that the first person to buy recreational marijuana in Colorado was <span class=s2><a href=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-101660.html>Sean Azzariti</a>, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD. (Colorado law currently forbids treating PTSD with medical marijuana.)</span></p> \\\\n<p class=p3>Azzariti's example speaks to one problem often raised by supporters of medical marijuana: sometimes allowing marijuana for medical purposes isn't enough; it's important for advocates to push states to expand the drug's medical availability.</p> \\\\n<h3>Epilepsy and seizures</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242877/698723.jpg class=photo alt=698723></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Researchers would like to give medical marijuana a deeper look. Michel Porro / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Although the scientific evidence is scarce, the Epilepsy Foundation <a href=http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2014/2/epilepsy-foundation-calls-increased-medical-marijuana-access-and-research>argues</a> that medical marijuana should be opened up to patients with epilepsy and uncontrollable seizures.</p> \\\\n<p class=p3>With medical marijuana spreading across the states, stories have trickled out claiming that marijuana helped solve people's struggles with epilepsy and seizures. A cancer patient, for example, <a href=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-27741-healthy_hits.html>told me</a> last year that taking marijuana eased her epilepsy, on top of her nausea and loss of appetite.<span class=s2> Without medical marijuana, I wouldn’t be alive today, she said. It really has changed my life for the better.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.</p> \\\\n<p>The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions. While this list is limited to six examples, it could certainly grow as legalization encourages doctors and researchers to take another look at a drug once marked as taboo.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3 <p>Thomas Piketty's book <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i> advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century>You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png class=photo alt=World_output>300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_britain>This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_germany>The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_the_united_states>American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \\\\n<h3> \\\\n<div id=slaves><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \\\\n</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United_states_with_slavery></p> \\\\n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png class=photo alt=Market_value_and_book_value>This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png class=photo alt=Income_composition>This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth_inequality>You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires></p> \\\\n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). </span></p> \\\\n<p>So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \\\\n<p>Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \\\\n<p>Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.</p> \\\\n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \\\\n<p><span> </span></p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \\\\n<p>We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \\\\n<p>This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.</p> \\\\n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/>told CNN</a> that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.</p> \\\\n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816>One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana>medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \\\\n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.</p> \\\\n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.</p> \\\\n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \\\\n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \\\\n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana>issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx>remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \\\\n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996>One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \\\\n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash.</p> \\\\n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \\\\n<p>A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase.</p> \\\\n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Some cities aren't resisting this offer.

       "5 <p>There's a very simple reason that Obamacare hit 8 million sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.</p> \\\\n<p>But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.</p> \\\\n<p><q>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.</q></p> \\\\n<p>Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/>prediction</a> that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/>not one of them</a> had given up.</p> \\\\n<p>I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.</p> \\\\n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \\\\n<p>If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment></p> \\\\n<p><br>People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>Obamacare's March madness</span></h3> \\\\n<p>Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the <i>entire </i>month of October.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.</span></p> \\\\n<p>The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. <span>California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. </span></p> \\\\n<p><q>15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.</q></p> \\\\n<p>For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.</p> \\\\n<p><span>This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.</span></p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector_enrollment.png alt=Connector_enrollment><span>But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.</span></p> \\\\n<p>It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.</p> \\\\n<h4>Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance</h4> \\\\n<p>There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.</p> \\\\n<p>We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.</p> \\\\n<p>They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.</p> \\\\n<p><span>The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.</span></p> \\\\n<p dir=ltr><span>On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.</span></p> \\\\n<p dir=ltr>But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.</p> \\\\n<p dir=ltr>That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says. But that they would stick through so much hassle still amazes us.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.</p> \\\\n<p><img alt=Charles_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Charles Gaba</p> \\\\n<p><span>But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as <a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/>the invaluable Charles Gaba</a>.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. </span><span>Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.</span><span> Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.</span></p> \\\\n<p>At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.</p> \\\\n<h3>'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png class=photo alt=State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions><br id=1396567685947> It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law &mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.</p> \\\\n<p>Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.</p> \\\\n<p>But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.</p> \\\\n<p><q class=right>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up</q></p> \\\\n<p><span>The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.</p> \\\\n<p>We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.</p> \\\\n<p>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.</p> \\\\n<p>You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day &mdash; one before work, one after &mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.</p> \\\\n<p>At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.</p> \\\\n<h3>'<span>For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'</span>\\\\n</h3> \\\\n<p>There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k>South Carolina</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k>New York</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts>Maryland</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension>Nevada</a><span>, </span><span>and </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers>California</a><span>. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. </span></p> \\\\n<p>The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.</p> \\\\n<p><span>The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups &mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors &mdash; announced prominently.</span></p> \\\\n<p><q class=left>I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going </q></p> \\\\n<p>The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.</p> \\\\n<p>It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.</p> \\\\n<div>Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. <span>The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. </span>\\\\n</div> \\\\n<div><br></div> \\\\n<p><span>In January, Gaba </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;>projected </a><span>that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.</span></p> \\\\n<p>For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.</p> \\\\n<p>This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>'I'm getting a little nervous.'</span></h3> \\\\n<p>Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers &mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.</p> \\\\n<p><span>My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. </span><span>I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.</span></p> \\\\n<p>We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).</p> \\\\n<p>I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.</p> \\\\n<p>Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March &mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.</p> \\\\n<p><span>It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on.

Psychologists Mike Morrison and Neal Roese called up 370 adults and asked them to report one regret of theirs in detail. As the <a href=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/2011/romantic-regrets.aspx>chart</a> shows, personal regrets were reported more than professional ones. While no single category dominated, the education, career, and finance categories amounted to only 35 percent of regrets reported. The rest dealt with things like romance, family, parenting, health, friendships, and spirituality.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-1 class=list-1 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2547882/Screenshot_2014-12-13_15.20.03.0.png></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf> \\\\n              Stone et al \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>This is what you regret from college</h4> \\\\n          <p>This chart, from a report by Charley Stone, Carl Van Horn, and Cliff Zukin from the Heldrich Center at Rutgers, shows <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf>the biggest regrets of 444 college grads</a> from the classes of 2006 through 2011, as stated in the spring of 2012. Some of these aren't really regrets, since they're not things that are totally under the control of the person in question (you can't conjure up offers for internships or part-time jobs out of thin air). But if you went to college, you probably had control over your major, and a plurality of respondents expressed regrets about their choice there. What do they think they should have done instead? Well, the survey also found a majority of all recent college graduates said they wish they had taken more computer and technology classes.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-2 class=list-2 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/ target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1405862/Screen_Shot_2014-09-29_at_1.42.06_PM.0.png></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/ target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/> \\\\n              Hamilton Project \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>But really, you should regret your major</h4> \\\\n          <p>Recent grads' major regrets have some basis. A paper by the Hamilton Project's Brad Hershbein and Melissa Kearney found substantial variation in median lifetime earnings by major. The median chemical engineering major earns $2.11 million over the course of her career, while the median early childhood education major makes $770,000 (which is distressing given what an important job that is). We don't know how much of this differential is caused by the majors themselves. Students who major in chemical engineering and those who major in early childhood education probably differ in a number of other ways that could also help explain the earnings gap. But especially when you're comparing between related fields where students are likely very similar — say, between chemical engineering and biomedical engineering — you can probably ascribe a good portion of the gap to the difference in specialty.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-3 class=list-3 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/what_happens_to_students_who_fail_to_complete_a_college_degree_is_some/ target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2549896/annual.0.jpg></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/what_happens_to_students_who_fail_to_complete_a_college_degree_is_some/ target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/what_happens_to_students_who_fail_to_complete_a_college_degree_is_some/> \\\\n              Hamilton Project \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>You should've gone to school longer</h4> \\\\n          <p>The causal evidence on majors is murky, but the evidence that going to school for longer increases your income isn't. There's a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/27/the-tuition-is-too-damn-high-part-ii-why-college-is-still-worth-it/>wide array of experimental and quasi-experimental evidence</a> suggesting that additional years of schooling increase your income. Twin studies — which are able to control for genetics and home environment — find that the twin with more education typically earns more. Studies utilizing the draft lottery — and subsequent access to free education among those selected to fight — find the same thing. People who drop out of high school when they turn 16 earn less if their birthday is in September (and so they miss both junior and senior years) than if it's in June or July (which means they only miss senior year). This chart shows how more schooling correlates with higher earnings, but there's a lot of evidence to suggest it causes higher earnings too.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-4 class=list-4 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment-ebook/dp/B00GWSXX26/ref=dp_ob_title_ebook target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4718370/siegel_returns.png></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment-ebook/dp/B00GWSXX26/ref=dp_ob_title_ebook target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment-ebook/dp/B00GWSXX26/ref=dp_ob_title_ebook> \\\\n              Jeremy Siegel \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>You should have invested more in stocks</h4> \\\\n          <p>Are you mostly invested in stocks?

If you put the money in bonds, you'd only get $1,778. If you put it in gold, you'd only have $4.52. It's always possible that the past two hundred years are an anomaly, but it's unclear why things would reverse course now.

That's pretty concerning, given how bad not paying off your card balance every month is. A CreditCards.com analysis based on data from the credit report agency Experian, the Federal Reserve, the New York Fed, TransUnion, and the Census, found that the average account that's paid off in full has $1,098 in debt, whereas the average account with a balance left on it has $7,743. This is intuitive and obvious at some level; if you pay your card off monthly, then your debt balance is just going to be a reflection of your spending patterns, whereas leaving a balance lets it gain interest and accumulate.

UEP guidelines mandate cages that have at least 67 square inches per bird, or a bit more than 8 by 8 inches. About 15 percent of hens, UEP told the Times, are raised by farmers who don't participate in its voluntary animal welfare program or otherwise don't meet that standard. These birds have even more smaller spaces. 2 percent of eggs are cage free, but that just means the hens are kept indoors in big barns, where they have a minimum of 120 square inches (a bit less than 11 by 11 inches), per UEP guidelines. Only 1 percent are free range, and even those offer limited access to the outdoors.

As this <a href=http://sr2learn.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/what-is-academic-rumination/>chart</a>, adapted from a paper by UC - Riverside's Sonja Lyubomirsky and Chris Tkach, illustrates, ruminating on negative thoughts and memories can unlock a vicious cycle that is deeply corrosive to happiness. Rumination in the context of a depressed mood may amplify the effects of the negative mood on thinking by selectively priming mood-relevant information and activating networks of negative memories, beliefs, expectations, and schemas, they write. In turn, the resulting negatively biased judgments and interpretations may maintain, or even enhance, depressed mood, nourishing the vicious cycle between depressed mood and thinking.

In Georgia's 12th district, Republican Rick Allen upset Rep. John Barrow, one of the last of the conservative Southern Democrats who dominated the House for decades and are now going extinct before our eyes.

Virginia and Alaska are still getting returns back and Louisiana is going to a runoff. Democrats got no surprise victories in states like Iowa and Colorado, and they lost North Carolina, where they were leading in late polls.

Obama won both of those states, twice. The other five confirmed Republican gains are concentrated in red states. Thom Tillis picked up North Carolina's seat, which Kay Hagan won in 2008. Arkansas Democrat Mark Pryor was walloped due to the state's rightward tilt and a national Republican wave; the same thing happened to fellow Arkansan Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln in 2010. Meanwhile, popular Democrats retired in three states — South Dakota, Montana, and West Virginia — making all three guaranteed GOP gains.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-4 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2432306/Governor_Results-4pmv2.0.gif target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2432306/Governor_Results-4pmv2.0.gif></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2432306/Governor_Results-4pmv2.0.gif target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Republicans had a good night in governor's races …</h4> \\\\n          <p>Democrats were optimistic they could unseat some unpopular Republican governors this cycle, but got just one of their wishes: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett lost to Democrat Tom Wolf. But Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democratic former Gov. Charlie Crist lost to Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott, despite leading in late polls. Republican Govs. Scott Walker, Sam Brownback, and Rick Snyder held on in Wisconsin, Kansas, and Michigan, respectively. And some Democratic incumbents, like Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, had surprise losses too. Charlie Baker beat Martha Coakley to gain the Massachusetts governorship for Republicans. Vermont's Pete Shumlin got less than a majority, meaning the race goes to the state legislature; both chambers are Democrat-controlled, so Shumlin will almost certainly win, but it's still not ideal. Governor's races weren't the silver lining to the Senate results Democrats hoped they'd would be. They were a disaster for Democrats too.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-5 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2435508/StateSenateControl-Post-Election-GIF.0.gif target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2435508/StateSenateControl-Post-Election-GIF.0.gif></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2435508/StateSenateControl-Post-Election-GIF.0.gif target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>… and state legislature elections</h4> \\\\n          <p>State legislature races <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7149547/congress-not-important-why-state-legislature-matters>matter tremendously</a> (ask <a href=http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/3/7149549/john-oliver-state-legislature-election-midterm>John Oliver</a> if you don't believe me) but they tend to get much less election coverage. A few states are still coming in as of this writing, but overall it's a very good night for Republicans. Republicans gained the New Mexico, Minnesota, West Virginia, and New Hampshire Houses. The Nevada Senate flipped too. The West Virginia Senate, also formerly in Democratic hands, is tied. While Republicans ran the New York State Senate due to an agreement with moderate Democrats before this election, they now control it outright. After this year's elections, Democrats will control fewer state legislatures than they have <a href=https://twitter.com/NCSLorg/status/530060630905352192>since 1860</a>.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <hr>\\\\n<h3>The issues</h3> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-7 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430432/marijuana_ballot_results.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430432/marijuana_ballot_results.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430432/marijuana_ballot_results.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Pot was legalized in Oregon and Alaska (and kind of in DC)</h4> \\\\n          <p><a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/6953771/weed-legalization-alaska-florida-oregon-washington-dc-vote#Oregon>Oregon</a> and <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/6953771/weed-legalization-alaska-florida-oregon-washington-dc-vote#Alaska>Alaska</a> passed outright marijuana legalization last night (yellow outlines indicate states that voted on pot during this election). 90 days after the election in Alaska is certified, adults over 21 will be able to possess up to an ounce of pot (which is quite a bit) and six marijuana plants. After that, the state has a year and a half to set up legal sales. Oregon's measure means that on July 1 of next year, adults over 21 can own up to <i>eight</i> ounces and four plants; the state has until 2016 to implement legal sales.

The unemployment rate has fallen dramatically, to about the same level as in 2002, a year when the incumbent Republicans actually gained seats. Then again, it's also the same level as 2006, when the president's party weathered massive losses. Economic factors just don't play the same, key role in midterms that they do in presidential elections. As UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/upshot/the-economy-elects-presidents-presidents-elect-congress.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1>puts it</a>: Instead of rewarding or punishing the incumbent president for his handling of the nation’s economy, in midterm years voters address the president more directly — by penalizing his party members, on average, but also by calibrating that punishment based on how the president is doing his job.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n      <div class=chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video><div data-ad-slot=athena_features></div></div> \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-12 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430748/structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430748/structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430748/structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Presidential approval is really important</h4> \\\\n          <p>Presidential approval ratings are a major factor in determining the victor in midterm races. That might seem counteirntuitive, given that the president isn't actually on the ballot, but the chart makes the inverse relationship between presidential approval and losses incurred by his party pretty apparent. Midterms almost never lead to gains for the president's party; that's only happened three times (1934, 1998, and 2002) in the past century, and under extraordinary circumstances in each case (the Great Depression, Bill Clinton's impending impeachment, and 9/11). The losses are worse when the president is personally unpopular. 2014 played into that pattern, as Obama's low approval ratings translated into heavy Democratic losses. Note that not all Senate and House races are in yet, meaning the numbers for this year are incomplete.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <hr>\\\\n<h3>The voters</h3> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-14 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2429580/race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2429580/race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2429580/race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>The electorate was whiter than in presidential elections</h4> \\\\n          <p>Midterm electorates are always whiter than presidential ones, and 2014 fit the pattern; 75 percent of voters were white, compared to 72 percent in 2012.

That sounds like a good thing, but it also means they have more wasted votes (that is, votes above the last one needed to win the election). If those wasted votes were distributed in other races, they could theoretically swing some additional seats toward Democrats. A significant factor here is that Democrats tend to cluster geographically in cities. Redistricting tends to lean in favor of keeping geographic regions together, which means heavily Democratic urban districts and less heavily Republican rural distrcts, implicitly advantaging Republicans. To avoid that, you'd need to draw districts that blend together areas with little in common (inner city Pittsburgh with central Pennsylvania, for example). These kinds of districts are, as political scientists Jowei Chen and Jonathan Rodden <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/opinion/sunday/its-the-geography-stupid.html?_r=0>put it</a>, unlikely to emerge by chance from a nonpartisan process, and they're <i>definitely</i> unlikely to emerge from a partisan, Republican-led redistricting process. And there were <a href=http://redistricting.lls.edu/who-partyfed.php>far more nonpartisan or Republican-led redistricting processes</a> than Democrat-run ones. The result is that wasted votes create a significant (~ 6%) advantage for Republicans, as illustrated by the chart above.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-26 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2428462/Screen_Shot_2014-11-04_at_5.46.40_PM.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf> \\\\n              National Atlas of the United States \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Gerrymandering helped both parties, but especially Republicans</h4> \\\\n          <p>Political scientists disagree about the degree to which gerrymandering is responsible for Republicans' House majority. But there's general agreement, as Vox's Andrew Prokop <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/how-important-is-gerrymandering-to-republican-control-of-the-house>put it</a>, that there have been some egregious partisan gerrymanders since the 2010 Census. Because Republicans controlled more state governments than Democrats did post-2010, those gerrymanders disproportionately benefited Republicans, but Democratic states got in on the action too. Here's Maryland's map, which divvies up liberal areas (Baltimore, the DC suburbs), then combines them with less liberal portions of the state; that means Democrats have smaller win margins but more seats overall, and only one seat (the one bordering Delaware) is left to be represented by a Republican. Compare that to Pennsylvania, where Republicans did the opposite: packing liberal urban segments into as few districts as possible, and conceding them to the Democrats to maximize Republican chances in the rest of the state.

Governor Anthony Brown was thought to be well ahead, and would have been the third elected black governor in American history (after Virginia's Doug Wilder and Massachusetts' Deval Patrick, who retired this year). A number of Democratic female candidates, like Massachusetts' Martha Coakley and Wisconsin's Mary Burke, were in close races in states with male incumbents. But all four of those candidates lost in the Republican wave. Republican women, by contrast, did quite well, with Oklahoma's Mary Fallin and New Mexico's Susana Martinez winning easily.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-46 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430868/women_in_congress.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430868/women_in_congress.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430868/women_in_congress.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Women in Congress cross the 100 mark</h4> \\\\n          <p>Regardless of your politics, it's worth celebrating the fact that, for the first time ever, more than 100 women are members of the House or Senate.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n  </ol> \\\\n<div class=chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video><div data-ad-slot=athena_features></div></div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n \\\\n<div class=feature-photos-related clearfix> \\\\n  <hr> \\\\n  <h3>Learn more</h3> \\\\n  <ul class=feature-photos-related-list> \\\\n     \\\\n    <li class=feature-photos-related-list-item> \\\\n      <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7159145/9-takeaways-from-the-2014-election> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-image style=background-image: url( 'http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/43460606/repost-us-15149561.0.0_standard_755.0.0.0_cinemaesque_1080.0.jpg' );></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-highlight></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-headline>9 takeaways from the 2014 election</div> \\\\n      </a> \\\\n    </li> \\\\n     \\\\n    <li class=feature-photos-related-list-item> \\\\n      <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7158621/wendy-davis-texas-election-results-2014> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-image style=background-image: url( 'http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/43450612/171542779.0.0_cinemaesque_1080.0.jpg' );></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-highlight></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-headline>Wendy Davis lost.

But once we’re underwater, I can see the rows and rows of PVC trees, suspended above the sand in a grid that stretches away into the distant murk.</p> \\\\n<p>This is a coral nursery. Each tree bears a ripening crop of a hundred or more pieces of coral. The smallest fragments are pinkie-sized, twirling on their tethers as other divers kick by; the largest hang like many-limbed chandeliers, turning slowly in the current. When I get closer, I can see the individual polyps, the anemone-like creatures that make up each fragmented colony. Nestled in the crenellated openings in their solid skeletons, they are waving their fleshy tentacles through the water, feeding.</p> \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n<div class=float-right s-sidebar> \\\\n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=3843486 src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3843486/GettyImages-159653970.0.jpg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;%0D%0A%0D%0A&lt;p&gt;&lt;a%20target= new href=http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming> </p> \\\\n \\\\n<a target=new href=http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming>Global warming, explained</a>\\\\n</div> \\\\n \\\\n<p>We are there to tend the trees: Each one needs to be surveyed, scrubbed of algae, and have its biggest corals subdivided into new cuttings. Any coral bleached by high temperatures or damaged by disease needs to be removed to a nearby heap. This is a daunting task considering that the Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF) maintains five coral nurseries with some 40,000 corals growing on trees just like these ones, all along the spattered arc of the Florida Keys.</p> \\\\n<p>Exaggerating her gestures, a woman named Patty shows us — a group of long-time volunteers and visiting divers — how to hang new cuttings in place of the corals we cut down. We exhale long streamers of air back toward the surface, and move slowly as we pass the shared pliers around, cutting and crimping monofilament with the slow-motion care of astronauts maneuvering in zero gravity.</p> \\\\n<p>I pick up a piece of coral, maybe eight inches long and forked at both ends. It’s a deep amber, except for the bright white tips of its branches. It’s hard to tell how heavy an object is underwater, but this one feels light: A small thing to pin the reef’s future on. I tag it with the name and number of its tree, and drop it into a milk crate with the others we’ve harvested.</p> \\\\n<p>Now it’s time to go plant a reef.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>I got here with a question:</strong> What happens to coral reefs as the ocean warms and acidifies over the coming century? Corals might seem removed from human society, but in fact that not-so-simple question leads to an even scarier follow-up: What happens to us?</p> \\\\n<p>Coral reefs are the richest ocean ecosystems we have — they support an estimated 25 percent of marine species. According to <a href=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3720e.pdf>a 2014 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, reefs are responsible for 17 percent of the protein we consume globally; in some coastal or island countries, like Sierra Leone or the Maldives, that number can be as high as 70 percent. Reefs serve as offshore larders, nurseries for important commercial fish (like tuna), and shelter for important ecological species (like sharks). They’re storm breaks for populated shores and bait for tourists whose dollars support entire local economies.</p> \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n<p>We know that reefs are crucial to the oceans as we know them, and to our societies as we’ve made them — and we know they are in serious trouble. According to one 2000 report, <a href=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Coral/>we’ve lost</a> 27 percent of coral worldwide, and stand to lose another 32 percent in the next 30 years.</p> \\\\n<p>What we don’t know is if there’s anything we can do about it. Luckily, that won’t stop people from trying: Around the world, a scrappy handful of scientists, entrepreneurs, and volunteers are taking on this colossal problem, one branch at a time.</p> \\\\n<p>From regrowing the reefs we’ve already lost to engineering new corals that may be able to survive hotter, more acidic seas, these innovators are fighting everything from nutrient pollution to overfishing to ocean warming itself. If we want to succeed, we might have to learn how to rebuild an entire ecosystem from the bottom up.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p> \\\\n<h3>Restoration</h3> \\\\n<p>What is a coral, really? It’s an animal, but it is also plantlike, an alien amalgam of many clades. It is made up of minuscule individuals and yet its colonies comprise the largest living structures in the natural world.</p> \\\\n<p>Zooming in reveals the tiny components and processes that make up the organism: the fleshy coral polyp within its calcium carbonate skeleton; the microscopic algae that live in symbiosis inside the cells of the animal; the complex microbial communities that live in and around all of them. You’d also observe the way ocean chemistry interacts intimately with the creatures, changing their ability to grow, or the way a half-degree difference in temperature can upset their delicately balanced cellular machinery.</p> \\\\n<p>Zooming out to the reefs themselves reveals geological structures reaching up from the seafloor, growing from millions of tiny mouths and built on the compiled skeletons of previous generations. These house fish and sea urchins that graze on the algae that might otherwise overgrow the corals, larger fish that eat <em>them</em>, and species like sharks, whose existence marks a well-balanced ecosystem and whose absence indicates disorder. Other organisms prey on the coral itself: The crown-of-thorns starfish is so fecund and insatiable that a single individual can populate whole square miles of reef, stripping the coral of its polyps and leaving dead, white skeletons behind.</p> \\\\n<p>Humans have a way of messing with coral at both ends of the scale, from altering the very chemistry of the water they grow in, to destroying thousands of miles of reef by dredging, polluting, overfishing, and just generally overloading them.</p> \\\\n<p>But some people think that in order to fix coral, we’ll have to keep meddling. We’ll just have to do it better.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288083>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288083/grist-coral-2.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>The Coral Restoration Foundation’s nursery is made up of PVC-pipe trees where corals grow quickly in the nutrient-rich current.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p><strong>Ken Nedimyer, founder of the Coral Restoration Foundation, leans hard on the coral-as-trees metaphor.</strong> If you can regrow a forest from a nursery, he thought, why not a reef? Aside from a few frustrating particulars and unknowns about coral husbandry, the model made sense to him. But no one had tried it.</p> \\\\n<p>In 40 years of diving in the Florida Keys, Nedimyer has watched the place change into something unrecognizable: The reefs I saw in the early ‘70s were just fabulous. I remember going to Carysfort, and it was just acres and acres of elkhorn coral, coming right to the surface. You couldn’t swim over it; you couldn’t see the end of it. Most of the reefs in the Florida Keys were like that.</p> \\\\n<p>As the stepping-stone islands filled up with people, the surrounding seas filled up with their boats and sewage. Until very recently, wastewater from the Florida Keys was flushed right out to sea or pumped into leaky septic systems. As a result, all those spectacular near-shore reefs that had made the place famous suffered a 30-year-long string of disease outbreaks, algal blooms, dredging, damage from boats, and overfishing. Today, the Carysfort Reef has mostly turned to skeletal rubble, overgrown with algae and largely empty of fish.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>The problem with coral in the Keys is not unique in the Caribbean.</strong> A <a href=http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf>comprehensive study</a> of the Caribbean’s reefs from 1972 to 2012 found that coral declined by more than 80 percent, with most of that loss concentrated in the ’80s and ’90s. An outbreak of White Band Disease knocked out almost all of the region’s staghorn and elkhorn corals — the branching corals that make up the bulk of the region’s reef structure. Another disease wiped out the local sea urchins that kept algae in check. Then in 1997 and 1998, the <a href=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/techrpts/tr9802/tr9802.pdf>strongest-ever El Niño</a> observed to date hit, and ocean temperatures shot up. Caribbean corals, struggling in the hot water, expelled their symbiotic algae and slowly starved to death, in some of the worst bleaching events in the history.</p> \\\\n<p>In the late ’90s, a series of papers proclaimed the end of reefs, eventual or imminent. Even if we could stop dumping so much (literal) shit and sludge on the reefs, we almost certainly couldn’t stop the global warming that had already started raising ocean temperatures above the threshold at which coral survival seemed impossible. Surely these fragile creatures, the foundation for so many critical ecosystems, would not be able to exist in that hot future world. Surely, they were all doomed.</p> \\\\n<p>But what seemed like a foregone conclusion to pessimistic scientists seemed like a call to arms for others. Nedimyer was of the latter. An aquarium collector, he spent most of his time underwater, catching tropical fish to sell to public and private aquariums. When an elkhorn coral started to grow on some aquarium live rock he was tending, Nedimyer had an idea. While elkhorn is a federally protected species in the Caribbean, the law was that anything growing on Ken’s live rock — including elkhorn — belonged to him. He could do what he wanted with it.</p> \\\\n<p>Nedimyer knew he could probably make a tidy fortune by growing the rare coral to sell cuttings to aquariums. But he wanted to do something bigger. So Nedimyer and his 13-year-old daughter started with a 4H project, fragmenting the original coral to grow each piece into a new colony. They were practicing for the nursery Nedimyer had pictured, an enormous underwater forest capable of restoring the Caribbean’s reefs to their former state, the way he had known them 40 years before.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288089>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288089/grist-coral-3.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>A thicket of transplanted staghorn coral takes root in the Florida Keys.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p><strong>In 2003, Nedimyer got federal permission to plant six corals</strong> in a spot on Molasses Reef in the Florida Keys. In 2007, after a string of bad luck and hurricanes that kept them off the reef, they planted 18. In 2015, Nedimyer and the small staff of the Coral Restoration Foundation, along with a legion of volunteers, have planted more than 18,000 of them.</p> \\\\n<p>Jessica Levy manages the CRF’s restoration program, which means she is out on the water most days — gathering corals from the nurseries, monitoring for signs of trouble, and planting new batches of coral on the reef. The corals she works with are the offspring of wild patches of elkhorn and staghorn that survived the mass die-offs of the last few decades.</p> \\\\n<p>If they’ve gone through bleaching events and survived, if they’ve gone through cold events and survived, they’re a stronger coral, Levy says. They’re the ones that you want to fragment and grow and plant back on the reef. The idea being, if they survived it then, they’ll survive it now.</p> \\\\n<p>In the nursery, coral grow two or three times faster than they grow on the reef. Suspended in the water column, they can gather nutrients from the current and grow in all directions without expending energy to affix themselves to the reef. Once planted, they spend a few months stabilizing, forming new tissue over the epoxy used to cement them in place. Then they start growing again.</p> \\\\n<p>Since they’re planted in groups of the same genotype, the corals grow together as they get bigger, forming tangled thickets that provide the kind of shelter and support a reef so badly needs. Levy says that, so far, about 80 percent of the transplants are still alive after two years on the reef. Impressive results, especially considering no one has ever tried a project like this at scale before.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288093>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288093/grist-coral-5.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>A volunteer coordinator for CRF readies a boatload of divers.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p>Nevertheless, Nedimyer and Levy and the rest of CRF know they are facing a Herculean task if they expect to replant all of Florida’s reefs by hand. But, luckily, they don’t. Even the reefs where they’ve been planting corals since the beginning are still mostly bare, featuring the odd thicket of staghorn or stubborn boulder coral.</p> \\\\n<p>Levy says CRF’s real goal is not to repopulate the reefs coral by coral, but to preserve the genetic diversity the species needs to stay resilient. By gathering corals from the reef, CRF can save genotypes that might otherwise be lost from the wild. Eventually, if CRF can just boost population density a little, the corals can start reproducing on their own again.</p> \\\\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles is that as these populations stand now, when they do go to spawn, they’re so far apart, Levy points out. Corals are hermaphroditic, producing bundles of both sperm and eggs during a yearly spawning event, but elkhorn and staghorn can’t fertilize themselves. They trust that their spawn will mingle in the water column, meet other coral spawn, fertilize, and avoid being eaten long enough to settle out and start growing new coral. But right now, says Levy, these guys are so fragmented that there’s no chance of meeting up.</p> \\\\n<p>It’s a big ocean. The goal was never to outplant every coral on every reef. That’s not sustainable, Levy says, on a rare day in her office on land. That’s the part that can be hard to explain to people, who can’t see the point of scattering a few thousand corals across reefs that once hosted millions. The goal is to get genetic diversity out there, to the point where they’re naturally reproducing. Basically, to boost natural recovery.</p> \\\\n<p>If that sounds like a big gamble to you — it is. But it might be our best bet.</p> \\\\n<div> \\\\n<div style=left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;><iframe style=top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; mozallowfullscreen=true webkitallowfullscreen=true allowfullscreen=true frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mEBPQPvo4c?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1></iframe></div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p></p> \\\\n<p><strong>To plant a coral, you first have to clear a place for it.</strong> You do this (I am a little alarmed to learn) with the chisel end of a hammer.</p> \\\\n<p>The day after we gathered our coral cuttings from the nursery, we go out on Molasses Reef, one of the most visited reefs in the Keys. I take a hammer from Patty and tentatively begin tapping the reef substrate, a compressed residue of coral rubble and sand, riddled with strange, iridescent sea worms.</p> \\\\n<p>This is not easy. Picture an astronaut trying to hammer a nail in space: For every fraction of an inch the nail goes in, the astronaut floats back a foot. In my case, each careful chisel blow to the rock sends me drifting upward like an untethered balloon. To stay down, I have to direct my head and all my attention downward while kicking steadily, as I scrape the rock clear of its algal fuzz.</p> \\\\n<p>I brace my coral firmly against a spot on the cleared substrate with one hand, while with the other I pinch off small globs of purple epoxy. Each branch gets a dab, and the whole thing goes down onto the spot I’ve cleared.</p> \\\\n<p>At least in theory: Between my own drift and wafting clouds of sediment from the divers chiseling on either side of me, it takes some maneuvering before I can get my branch of staghorn anchored firmly to the rock. To test its structural integrity, I wave my hand over it like I’m trying to fan out a flame. Sediment flies up in a cloud, but my coral — it stays put. Success.</p> \\\\n<p>It takes about 40 minutes for four of us to plant all 10 corals in one thicket, an area easily encompassed by a hula-hoop. As all the groups start to ascend, I can’t help but think that it doesn’t look like much. Together, we have managed to plant a single milk-crate’s worth of corals over a badminton court-sized patch of seafloor. This on the bare, rocky remains of a reef that stretches to the limits of visibility.</p> \\\\n<p>But something happens as we continue to rise. Fish dart in to fill the space we have made, rushing to gulp the worms we’ve dislodged in all that scraping and hammering. Suddenly, our sad jumble of coral looks a lot more like a habitat.</p> \\\\n<p>From 20 feet above the sea floor, I can see thickets of staghorn planted in the previous year or so. I can see how the disparate pieces of coral have grown up and together, knitting their branches into a kind of a dome. I can see, finally, where they have grown over the epoxy lumps that first sealed them to the reef. They have already taken root.</p> \\\\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p> \\\\n<h3>Selection</h3> \\\\n<p>On a tiny island called Ofu, part of American Samoa just south of the equator and east of the International Date Line, corals are doing something that might have once seemed impossible.</p> \\\\n<p>Under the intense heat of the southern sun, in a shallow lagoon where water temperatures can reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit, coral reefs are thriving. While corals elsewhere struggle when water temperatures reach the mid ’80s, these equatorial corals can handle the extra degrees without breaking a sweat. Those are the kinds of water temperatures people expect to see by the end of this century, which means, in a sense, Ofu’s corals are already living in the future.</p> \\\\n<p>Marine biologist Steve Palumbi wants to find out how these corals are so chill about extreme heat. A researcher at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, Palumbi wanted to know if these outlying supercorals could hold the key to a secret resiliency available to all corals.</p> \\\\n<p>Corals live in a very variable environment and they have for millions of years, Palumbi tells me one afternoon, in his office in Monterey, Calif. So it stands to reason that perhaps, in corals that live right now, there are already some that have adapted to live in future environments.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288129>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288129/coral-grist.6.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>Thickets of coral growing in the super-heated water off of Ofu, in American Samoa.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p>So Palumbi took a team of researchers and students to Ofu to put the supercorals through their paces. He chose to focus on a type of <em>Acropora</em> — the same genus that includes elkhorn and staghorn corals — called tabletop corals. As their name suggests, they grow in broad, table-like ledges, gathering as much solar energy as they can and providing shelter and shade for other species.</p> \\\\n<p>Fast-growing and generally susceptible to heat extremes, <em>Acropora</em> are both a fundamental builder of reef architecture and usually one of the more fragile species on the reef. If Ofu’s tabletops seemed hardier than usual, Palumbi was determined to find out why.</p> \\\\n<p>Using portable water coolers (the kind you’d use to stash a couple six-packs at a picnic) rigged with heating and refrigerating elements, the researchers took fragments of coral from the reef and subjected them to a uniform battery of stress tests. As the temperatures inched up, and the corals became more and more stressed, they started to expel the photosynthetic algae they need to live, and eventually bleached.</p> \\\\n<p>Here’s what’s interesting: The corals the researchers chose for testing came from different parts of the same reef, some of which experienced much higher temperatures on a regular basis. These warm-adjusted corals were much less likely to bleach under high temperatures than those that came from cooler parts of the reef.</p> \\\\n<div> \\\\n<div style=left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;><iframe style=top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; mozallowfullscreen=true webkitallowfullscreen=true allowfullscreen=true frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/--XHZZKu-ac?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1></iframe></div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p></p> \\\\n<p><strong>There are two mechanisms by which these corals (or any organism really) can adjust to an extreme environment</strong> — increased temperature, for example. The first, acclimation, is a short-term process whereby individual organisms change their physiology to become more heat tolerant. Then there’s adaptation, the longer-term process of natural selection whereby certain individuals pass on the genetic traits that make them more successful in warmer environments.</p> \\\\n<p>In other words: Acclimation is the tan you get on vacation, while adaptation is the skin tone you’re born with. In both cases, having more pigment in your skin reduces your risk of getting sunburned. So an organism’s life history might approximate some of the advantages of a genetic predisposition, through different mechanisms.</p> \\\\n<p>With corals, the combination of the two factors is more powerful than either on its own. To test this, Palumbi’s team transplanted corals from the cooler part of the reef to the warmest pool. They left them there for three years, after which the researchers subjected them to the same set of stress tests they’d undergone three years earlier, raising the temperature to an extreme level for several days at a time.</p> \\\\n<p>This time, the cool-adapted corals that had spent the last three years acclimating in warm pools did noticeably better than their cold-water clones. But the original warm-pool corals still outperformed their acclimated cousins, suggesting some older genetic advantage was also at work.</p> \\\\n<p>The next step, Palumbi says, is to start trying to use these supercorals to help corals in general. To that end, his PhD student, Megan Morikawa, is establishing a coral nursery off the coast of Ofu, where she hopes to cultivate the most resilient, heat-tolerant corals they find. Like Nedimyer, they want to replenish reefs with corals, and with the genetic diversity that will allow them to survive in a range of environments.</p> \\\\n<p>It’s too early to know if this will work. Palumbi is hopeful that something can be done, but aware of the challenges in scaling this kind of experiment up to a level where it can actually be effective.</p> \\\\n<p>You can’t go to a replanted reef, he says in his office, thousands of miles away from Ofu. You can go to a replanted forest, but as of now, there is no replanted reef.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288135><img src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288135/coral-grist.7.jpg></div> \\\\n<p><strong>When a coral bleaches, it doesn’t necessarily die</strong> — which means some interesting things can happen after a bleaching event sweeps a reef.</p> \\\\n<p>A coral polyp gathers some of its food from the water current, but it gets most of its energy by harvesting the sun’s energy, using tiny algae called zooxanthellae that live inside its cells. As the water heats up, those little algae start to produce chemicals that irritate the coral cells. As these so-called free radicals build up, they start to damage the cell until the coral polyp gets so agitated it expels most or all of its zooxanthellae.</p> \\\\n<p>From then, the coral polyp is essentially on its own. It loses the pigment it gets from its symbiont algae, turning pale white, and loses the energy it gets from photosynthesis. Without that energy, the coral feeds on its reserves and strains what food it can get from the water column. It stops growing and is at risk of eventually starving to death.</p> \\\\n<p>If the temperature drops again, the polyp can take up new zooxanthellae from the water and keep growing as before. But the longer the coral stays bleached, the less likely it will be able to recover.</p> \\\\n<p>However, there is a secondary effect to all this bleaching and unbleaching, which Palumbi and others have seized on as a possible source of hope. After a coral has bleached once, the next time it is subjected to abnormally high temperatures, it is much less likely to succumb.</p> \\\\n<p>In the same El Niño season that wiped out Florida’s corals, the reefs around the tiny island nation of Palau bleached <a href=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380100151>extensively</a>. Today, nearly 10 years later, they have almost completely recovered, Palumbi says. In fact, at this point most reefs in the world have bleached, he says. And a good number of them have recovered.</p> \\\\n<p>So corals are resilient, maybe more than we thought, and can recover from near-fatal events. But how fast can they keep up? In all their history — and at <a href=http://www.coris.noaa.gov/about/what_are/>400 million years</a>, it’s a long one — the organisms have never experienced a rate of change like what they are subjected to today.</p> \\\\n<p>What’s more, a coral’s vulnerability to and recovery from bleaching have a lot to do with the presence of other stressors, Palumbi points out. With pollution, habitat destruction, overfishing, sedimentation, and so on, what would be a tolerable amount of climate change can become an intolerable amount.</p> \\\\n<p>In this sense, Ofu is a lucky place to be a coral. Sure, the corals living in the sheltered lagoons of the remote island may have to put up with 95 degrees F — but they don’t have to deal with many humans.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>Corals can adapt and acclimate to higher temperatures — but only to a point.</strong> Even Palumbi’s supercorals, subjected to monstrously high temperatures in the stress tanks, have a limit. Eventually, given enough global warming, the world’s reefs will find their limits, too.</p> \\\\n<p>I can’t do everything, Palumbi admits. But if I can just help keep the ocean alive long enough for us to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels, we can make it.</p> \\\\n<p>This summer, Palumbi brought 80 corals back from Ofu, small fragments from the different genotypes and environments he was hoping to test in the lab. Then all but two of the corals died when he got them to the lab, and they took their heat-resisting secrets with them. Palumbi will have to go back to the reef and start over. But he’s determined to find the corals of the world that possess the superpower to resist higher ocean temperatures, and protect them.</p> \\\\n<p>Saving the ocean for the next 85 years — that’s a pretty good job, he says. I just need to show people that it is worth it.</p> \\\\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong></p> \\\\n<h3>Evolution</h3> \\\\n<p>The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences stands alone at the tip of Queensland’s Cape Cleveland and looks out over the Coral Sea, toward the Great Barrier Reef.</p> \\\\n<p>Inside sits an array of temperature- and pH-controlled tanks, sediment pumps, and stacks of high-octane computers. With all that tech, AIMS, a federally funded research center, can feel a little like NASA, if NASA were dropped in the middle of Australia and had its laser-assisted focus retrained on the oceans. High-security access badges: Check. Brilliant, high-powered scientists: Check. Evocative acronyms: So many checks.</p> \\\\n<p>The blocky brick building I come to at the end of 50 km of wallaby-strewn highway is an unassuming advertisement for the pie-in-the-sky projects unfolding inside. And so, with not a little cognitive dissonance, I sign my name on a standard-issue clipboard, and head to the world’s first Sea Simulator — the SeaSim, for short.</p> \\\\n<p>The 10,000-square-foot facility was built with the help of a $27 million <a href=http://www.scienceinpublic.com.au/media-releases/37-million-sea-simulator>grant</a> from the Australian government (that’s $37 million in AUD) and the ambition to do the kinds of long-running, multi-variable experiments never before possible in run-of-the-mill marine biology labs.</p> \\\\n<p>The sprawling building contains an upper story with a double row of sealed rooms, each controlled by a monitor panel outside. In some, heavy-duty pumps suspend dredge sediment in tanks lit a deep dance-club blue; others hold aquariums full of crown-of-thorns starfish, nightmarish, spiny creatures whose unchecked appetites have decimated whole swaths of reef.</p> \\\\n<p>But downstairs, I find what I came for: an enormous, open-plan room that will hold the nine tanks of Madeleine van Oppen’s time machine.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>In February of this year,</strong> Madeleine van Oppen and her colleague Ruth Gates of the University of Hawaii published a paper suggesting that we start researching whether it’s possible for humans to help corals evolve to survive in a climate-changed world.</p> \\\\n<p>They called it assisted evolution, and it was a new approach to the same old problem: Corals already possess some innate resilience, but they cannot evolve fast enough to keep up with the accelerating pace of climate change. So let’s just make them evolve faster.</p> \\\\n<p>With a grant from the Paul-Allen-funded <a href=http://www.pgafamilyfoundation.org/oceanchallenge/>Ocean Challenge</a> prize, covering a five-year-long research project split between AIMS and the University of Hawaii, van Oppen and company set out to see if that’s even possible. If they could breed new generations of corals that outperformed their parents, maybe they could identify the secret to coral resilience, be it genetic, microbial, or something else altogether.</p> \\\\n<p>And for that, they need corals. A lot of them.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288139>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288139/coral-grist.9.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>AIMS staff unload samples of coral and sand from the Great Barrier Reef, to be used in SeaSim experiments.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p>The boat comes in in the afternoon. Van Oppen drives me down to the port, where researchers with a heavy crane are lifting pallets of stacked plastic bins from the deck of the dive boat into the back of a truck. It’s sunny, so they work fast — these corals have come from Davies Reef, a nearby patch of the Great Barrier, and they are likely feeling the heat.</p> \\\\n<p>As he sloshes excess seawater out of the bins, research manager Neal Cantin explains to me what they’ve brought back: entire tubs of sand and sediment, heaps of worn-down and overgrown old coral skeletons (or live rock), some algae and sponges for a different experiment, and, of course, about 80 coral colonies for van Oppen’s experiment.</p> \\\\n<p>The corals are the main event, but the sand and sundry are important, too. With all these ingredients — and the ambient microbial communities they host — the researchers can create a rough copy of the reef the corals just left. Then, using data from a weather tower right over Davies Reef, they can adjust the water temperature throughout the day to match natural conditions as closely as possible.</p> \\\\n<p>I hitch a ride back to the SeaSim with a couple of tubs of coral and live rock. There, in the largest chamber of the Sea Simulator, Cantin and a graduate student are arranging the corals in three long tanks, flushed with seawater and lit with full-spectrum LEDs that mimic sunshine. These tanks will serve as an indoor ocean to these corals for the next five years, or longer.</p> \\\\n<p>Eventually, there will be nine tanks in the enormous, hangar-like room, grouped by threes: One trio will be treated with water heated and cooled to match the real-time temperature data from Davies Reef. The pH levels will match normal variations the reef might experience over the course of an average day, becoming more acidic at night, in the absence of photosynthesis. The second set will have its water heated and soured to match the ocean conditions we are predicted to experience by midcentury. The third will experience the most extreme conditions, with temperatures and acidity mimicking what we might see by 2100 if climate change is left unchecked.</p> \\\\n<p>All the corals will spend a few months acclimating to these new normals. The scientists expect many of them will become stressed, even bleach — but that’s only the beginning. What they really want to find out is how the kids do.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>The idea that humans might assist evolution, while it sounds wacky, is not truly anything that new.</strong> We’ve been changing the evolution of plenty of species, intentionally and otherwise, for about as long as we’ve been living in social groups. We assist evolution when we breed animals to perpetuate traits — milk production, for example, or docile behavior — that we find beneficial. We also can be said to assist evolution when we build environments, like cities, where certain animals, like pigeons, can find an ecological niche that never existed in the wild.</p> \\\\n<p>And we’re <em>already</em> applying selective pressures to coral. From global warming to ocean acidification, we’re changing the natural environment such that some corals are better adapted to survive than others. But evolution, while it’s happening, is not happening fast enough — and those selective pressures of ocean acidification and ocean warming run the risk of selecting reefs right out of existence.</p> \\\\n<p>Genetic selection is the most familiar kind of evolution, but the process of accumulating genetic adaptations is typically a slow one, reliant on chance mutations that occur in the right place at the right time. And corals only spawn once a year and grow slowly — which means there aren’t many chances to get things right.</p> \\\\n<p>So van Oppen’s group is looking to find the helpful mutations first, and maybe eventually find a way to spread them among wild corals. She is also looking for epigenetic changes in the corals, which is a catch-all term for the things that act on the genome, but are not a part of it.</p> \\\\n<p>For example, certain molecules may be attached to parts of an organism’s DNA, controlling whether a certain gene is turned on or off. If the gene is turned off, the cell won’t produce the protein that the gene codes for. In this way, an individual of a species may possess all the genes necessary to produce some trait without actually <em>expressing</em> the trait — all depending on its epigenetics.</p> \\\\n<p>These epigenetic markers have, in some cases, seemed to be heritable from a parent organism to its offspring. Van Oppen believes that epigenetics may hold the key to jump-starting corals’ non-traditional evolution in the face of warmer, more acidic waters. And if we can get a head-start on climate change by seeing what these changes might look like, maybe we can help nudge today’s reefs in the direction they need to go.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288141>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288141/coral-grist.10.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>Baby <em>Pocillopora</em> growing up in the SeaSim tanks.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p><strong><em>Pocillopora</em></strong><strong> — poss-ill-uh-pour-uh — </strong><strong><em>acuta</em></strong><strong> are pale, knobby lumps of coral</strong>, each about the size and shape of a head of cauliflower. They are fast-growing and branching, which makes them important reef building species, not unlike the more common <em>Acropora</em>.</p> \\\\n<p>But <em>Pocillopora</em> do one weird thing differently from most other corals. Instead of spawning just once a year, <em>Pocillopora</em> can reproduce asexually, releasing fully formed clonal larvae every month or so. In van Oppen’s lab, these larvae will settle onto little ceramic discs prepared by researchers and start to grow. Some of the baby corals will be moved around — the hot future larvae back to cold present-day tanks, and vice versa — to see how they do. Then this whole step will be repeated one more time, with a third generation of corals.</p> \\\\n<p>If the second- and third-generations of corals born and raised in future ocean conditions seem robust, that may tell us about how reefs could change in real-time. But even if corals are capable of keeping up with stressfully high temperatures and acidity, they still may change in ways that will fundamentally change the reefs themselves. The corals may not grow as fast, and they may reproduce differently. Larvae might have more trouble developing, or might develop differently.</p> \\\\n<p>And if the third generation of <em>Pocillopora</em> do end up stronger than their forebearers? The next step could be one of sci-fi proportions: to take these speed-evolved corals out onto the reef. These ultra resilient corals could potentially be used to restore damaged reefs, while providing a set of genes that could pass some of that accelerated resilience on to the next generation.</p> \\\\n<p>The other experiments van Oppen’s team will be running have some similarly stunning implications. For example, if the scientists experimentally evolve a strain of symbiotic zooxanthellae that makes its coral host more resistant to bleaching, they could conceivably grow huge tanks of it, to dump on reefs during especially hot spells.</p> \\\\n<p>To be clear, these are all pretty long shots for a lot of different reasons. But even if they’re shown to work, is it a good idea?</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>It’s not up to us in the end</strong> whether it will actually be implemented, Madeleine van Oppen told me, before I could even ask. Her experiments are such an early step on the road to large-scale reef engineering that she only spends a few minutes talking about the possibility. For van Oppen, the important thing is that we at least start asking the right questions. Answering them is a whole different research project.</p> \\\\n<p>What we definitely don’t want to do, she says, is to introduce new problems into a system we’ve already thrown out of whack. We are very good at messing things up, changing this planet tremendously, van Oppen says. We’re also very innovative and intelligent, I suppose. We’ve come up with lots of good solutions.</p> \\\\n \\\\n<div class=float-right s-sidebar> \\\\n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=4289589 src=https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4289589/climate-change.png&gt;&lt;/p&gt;%0D%0A%0D%0A&lt;p&gt;&lt;a%20target= new href=http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9567863/climate-change-ambitious-cuts> </p> \\\\n \\\\n<a target=new href=http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9567863/climate-change-ambitious-cuts>The math on staying below 2°C of global warming looks increasingly brutal</a>\\\\n</div> \\\\n \\\\n<p>One thing is sure: We’ll have to put the brakes on climate change eventually, if we want to stave off disaster — on this point, everyone agrees. But even if we phase out greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 or 20 years, the atmosphere and oceans will continue to warm for years after — so we need to be prepared to deal with that.</p> \\\\n<p>In a certain light, this crisis is nothing new for humans, says van Oppen: We pollute the environment and then we clean it up. We develop bacteria that can digest hydrocarbons when there’s been an oil spill. It’s no different from other things where we clean up after the mess we have made. We do that all the time. Unfortunately, that’s how humans are.</p> \\\\n<p>I’m starting to get the sense that if scientists, governments, and nonprofits can figure out how to engineer a better coral reef, it will be because, in the end, it’s easier to change nature itself than it is to change human nature.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p>The Great Barrier Reef is a bucket list item if there ever was one. It’s the largest living barrier reef in the world, roughly <a href=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/about-the-reef/facts-about-the-great-barrier-reef>the size of Italy</a>, and one of the only biological objects visible from space.</p> \\\\n<p>Home to some of the strangest (and most venomous) creatures in the ocean, the GBR is a poster child of what we stand to lose as the oceans warm. I had always wanted to see it for myself.</p> \\\\n<p>So one morning, on an ocean as flat and blue as a swimming pool, empty of other boats all the way to the cloud-strewn horizon, I hold a mask and regulator to my face and step into the water.</p> \\\\n<p>Underneath, huge mounds of coral rise 30 feet from the seafloor almost to the surface. I am surprised to find that these seamounts — called bommies in Aussie — are veritable catalogue advertisements of reef health and diversity. I see all kinds of <em>Acropora</em> — big, branching thickets of elkhorn, wide terraces of tabletop coral — all colored a healthy deep orange or yellow. <em>Pocillopora</em> sit on the tops of lower mounts like frilly heads of lettuce. I see enormous brain corals and tiny, fine-fingered soft corals that swayed in the current.</p> \\\\n<p>All around these pillars and buttresses, life swarms and flashes like static electricity: angelfish, damselfish, clownfish, a massive school of yellow-finned jacks winding between two bommies. There are skates bearing blue spots the size of silver dollars and parrotfish in all the colors of an ’80s aerobics instructor’s leotard. Electric-blue seastars stand out like asterisks on the sand, where giant clams flick their purple lips as I swim over.</p> \\\\n<p>If there is trouble on the Great Barrier Reef — and, by all accounts, there is — I can’t see a sign of it from behind my mask. In all its wild wholeness, this little patch of Edenic reef seems to stand both for what has been lost everywhere else, and what we stand to save.</p> \\\\n<p>But as I haul myself back out of the water — suddenly transformed back into a clumsy two-legged creature wearing 60 pounds of dive equipment and a fogged mask in front of my face — I feel both smaller and bigger than before. No matter how much I wanted to believe it while I was underwater, I knew that the idea of a pristine reef is an illusion. There are no virgin reefs to preserve. Any reef, any ecosystem, no matter how lovely, is in the process of being affected by the 7 billion (and counting) people of the world.</p> \\\\n<p>But that’s the way it’s always been. The reef is always changing: It is fed by currents and smashed by storms, and subject to the whims of the animals moving in waves over it. Flux is a fact of nature, and humans are now a part of that. If we want to start setting right some of the balances we’ve upset, coral reefs are as good a symbol as any of where our real work begins — at the intersection between the world and ourselves.</p> \\\\n<p><em>This story was supported by a grant from the </em><em><a href=http://earthjournalism.net/>Earth Journalism Network</a></em><em>.</em></p> \\\\n<p><em>Grist is a nonprofit news site that uses humor to shine a light on big green issues.

       "           \\\\nA state representative from Alabama wrote a Facebook post this weekend in which she threatened to expose the affairs of politicians trying to restore the state's ban on same-sex marriage, Kent Faulk of AL.com reports. \\\\nState Rep. Patricia Todd (D) — the first openly gay legislator elected in Alabama — had praised a federal judge's January 23 ruling striking down the ban. But when the House Speaker and Attorney General argued that a higher court should stay the order, Todd posted this on Facebook: \\\\n \\\\n\"This (is) a time where you find out who are accepting, loving people. To say I am disappointed in Speaker Hubbard comment's and Attorney General Strange choice to appeal the decision is an understatement. I will not stand by and allow legislators to talk about 'family values' when they have affairs, and I know of many who are and have. I will call our elected officials who want to hide in the closet OUT\" \\\\n \\\\nLater, Todd stood by her unusual threat, arguing that the circumstances called for it, as you can see in the video up top. \"Think about all the people in this room, and all the love that you feel for each other and these couples who are about to make history of being the first couples married in the state of Alabama,\" she said. \"We have families that will now be legitimized overnight. Children who will be affected and be able to call both parents 'mom' or 'dad.'\" \\\\n\"This is the fight of our life. This is why I ran for office.\" \\\\nTodd continued: \"That's a true family value. Many of you all know that I have thrown the gauntlet down to my elected peers that should they decide to go and spout that family value, then I'm gonna call 'em out. And I'm willing to jeopardize my political campaign to do it. This is the fight of our life. This is why I ran for office. I'm not a politician, I'm an activist.\" \\\\nA district court judge has issued a short-term stay on the Alabama ruling, pending appellate court action — so same-sex couples can't currently marry in the state. If the appellate court takes no action by February 9, the lower court ruling striking down the same-sex marriage ban will go into effect.

       "           \\\\nFBI Director James Comey gave a speech Thursday acknowledging the \"hard truths\" about racial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system. \\\\nComey spoke frankly about improving the police's relationship with young black men: \\\\n \\\\nThose of us in law enforcement must redouble our efforts to resist bias and prejudice. We must better understand the people we serve and protect. By trying to know, deep in our gut, what it feels like to be a law-abiding, young black man walking down the street and encountering law enforcement. We must understand how that young man may see us. We must resist the lazy shortcomings of cynicism. \\\\n \\\\nComey's speech attempted to invoke a middle ground in recent debates about racial disparities. He argued that police officers \"are overwhelmingly doing the right thing for the right reasons.\" But he also said he's not trying to \"let law enforcement off the hook.\" \\\\nComey said police must develop processes to overcome their subconscious biases against minority groups. Research shows this bias is real: studies prove that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado at Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research, previously said it's possible the bias could lead to more skewed outcomes in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" he said, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\" \\\\nComey also argued that the FBI and police must improve the ways they collect data on arrests and shootings, echoing a call made by US Attorney General Eric Holder. Currently, the federal government doesn't collect comprehensive data on people killed by police or officers killed in attacks. The FBI gathers some data, but the figures are generally viewed as the minimum numbers, since reporting by police departments is voluntary. \\\\nRacial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system have received a lot of attention in the past year, particularly after the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. The shooting of Brown set off a  nationwide movement to raise awareness about the death of young black men, under the banner, \"Black Lives Matter.\" \\\\nComey's full speech is available at the FBI's website. \\\\nVideo taken from Time magazine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              :    1  \n",
       "           \\\\nThe city of Cleveland argued in court that Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy, caused his own death when a police officer shot and killed him after mistaking Rice's pellet gun for an actual firearm. But following criticisms over the accusation, city officials apologized and vowed to change the language in a future court document. \\\\n\"This is not the character or personality of the city of Cleveland … to be that insensitive to family or even to victims,\" Cleveland Mayor Frank  Jackson said at a news conference on Monday, Cleveland.com reported. \\\\nThe city originally presented the argument in a court document responding to a lawsuit from the Rice family. The response stated that Rice's death was caused \"by the failure … to exercise due care to avoid injury,\" according to Cleveland.com. It also said that all of the injuries claimed by his family \"were directly and proximately caused by their own acts,\" not Timothy Loehmann, the officer who fatally shot Rice. \\\\nThe city claimed Rice's death was caused \"by the failure ... to exercise due care to avoid injury\" \\\\nImani Gandy at RH Reality Check pointed out that this type of language is standard in legal responses to wrongful death lawsuits. But the connotations of the defense still greatly offended people, particularly the Rice family that had already lost a 12-year-old son. \\\\nLoehmann shot Rice while he carried a toy airsoft gun on November 22, and Rice died at the hospital the following day. Video of the incident shows police officers arriving to the park where Rice was playing, and Loehmann shooting the boy within two seconds of getting out of the car. \\\\nPrior to the incident, a 911 caller told a dispatcher that a child was waving a gun around in the park but that it was \"probably fake.\" The full information was not relayed to officers, according to authorities. \\\\nPolice said, according to Cleveland.com, that Rice was sitting under a pavilion in the park with a few people, suggesting that the boy could have been a threat to others. But the video footage shows Rice was sitting alone as police pulled up. \\\\nThe Associated Press reported that police also claimed that the officer who opened fire on Rice asked the boy to put his hands up three times, suggesting that Rice was given ample warning before he was shot. The video footage doesn't disprove this, but it suggests that Loehmann would have given the commands fairly quickly, since he shot Rice within two seconds of his squad car pulling up to the park pavilion. \\\\nCleveland's original response to the lawsuit also claimed that the city was not aware of Loehmann's troubled history at other police departments. Loehmann resigned from the Independence, Ohio, Police Department in 2012 after he was deemed unfit for duty, in part because he couldn't properly handle a firearm. Other records reported by Cleveland.com showed that Loehmann failed the written entrance exam in 2013 for the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department. He also reportedly failed to get hired at police departments in Akron, Euclid, and Parma Heights after he left Independence. \\\\nThe city of Cleveland, which handed the shooting investigation to the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office for a more independent process, said it can't respond to some of the lawsuit's claims in full because the county's investigation into the shooting isn't completed. \\\\nThe county is currently investigating the Rice shooting and presenting the evidence to a grand jury. The Rice family separately filed a lawsuit against the city for the shooting. \\\\nFurther reading: Cleveland police shot and killed black 12-year-old Tamir Rice as he carried a toy gun.:    1  \n",
       "           \\\\nThis week, former President Bill Clinton taped an interview for the Rachael Ray Show — and Ray caught him flat-footed with a hard-hitting question he clearly had no response to. \"There is a possibility that you will return to the White House yet again,\" Ray said. \"I really wanna know, what would you then be called? Would you be ‘First Fella?' Would you be 'Mr. and Mrs. Presidents?'\" \\\\nClinton was unprepared, and began by answering an unrelated question, saying, \"If the president is a man, you call the president's spouse the First Lady, so we'll have to cross this bridge if a gay couple ever\" enters the White House. Then he tried to offer his own response, with a Bible joke: \"But let's say, if a woman became president — I could be called Adam. The first man? I don't know.\"  \\\\nRay and the crowd laughed far too hard given the quality of the joke. For some other possibilities, including \"First Gentleman\" and \"First Husband,\" check out this rundown from Jaime Fuller.
