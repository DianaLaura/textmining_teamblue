&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T&lt;span&gt;hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=right&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. &lt;/span&gt;More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W&lt;span&gt;hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. &lt;span&gt;You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969. (Flickr/&lt;a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294438012/&gt;FastLizard4&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first open financial network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin network serves the same purpose as mainstream payment networks such as Visa or Western Union. But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with &lt;a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf&gt;hundreds of pages&lt;/a&gt; of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Finding Bitcoin's killer app&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=left&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;People have been &lt;a target=_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world&gt;building Bitcoin ATMs&lt;/a&gt; to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are &lt;a target=_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/&gt;329 of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;&lt;a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;&gt;401(K) 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what &lt;a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590&gt;happened to Paypal&lt;/a&gt; 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;</td></tr>\n",

exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There's a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat — and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine. But the evidence remains quite limited, largely as a result of prohibition and strict federal oversight of medical research.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it, says Sue Sisley, a doctor and researcher at the University of Arizona. It is negligent for these 20 states to go selling cards to marijuana patients without actively conducting rigorous medical marijuana research that's necessary.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=center&gt;Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Sisley wants to study marijuana as a treatment for military veterans with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), but it took until March — &lt;a href=http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/timeline/&gt;nearly four years after the study's conception&lt;/a&gt; — for the study to get federal approval. First, she needed the Food and Drug Administration to sign off. Then, her team waited three years for approval from the Public Health Service to obtain legal marijuana supplies. &lt;span&gt;(No other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ds.shtml&gt;schedule 1 drug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;needs the extra round of approval,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.maps.org/media/view/press_release_public_health_service_blocks_fda-approved_medical_mariju/&gt;according to Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It's a long process, Sisley says. And we believe the only reason we got the Public Health Service approval, finally, was because of really strong advocacy from our veterans all over the country who were asking the federal government why they were blocking this research.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the difficulties, some marijuana research managed to get approval in the United States and other countries over the past few years. And the findings so far suggest a drug that holds the potential to treat some medical problems better than traditional medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4243637/482681757.jpg class=photo alt=482681757&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could relieve foot pain. Anadolu Agency&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Among the most obvious medical qualities of marijuana is its use as a painkiller. At least &lt;a href=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/182/14/E694.abstract&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=https://www.neurology.org/content/68/7/515.abstract&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; found marijuana can successfully treat different kinds of pain, including a difficult-to-treat kind called neuropathic pain and pain among HIV/AIDS patients.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The major advantage to marijuana as a painkiller is it could reduce reliance on more addictive, dangerous opiates. One study &lt;a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering &lt;a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills&gt;how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse&lt;/a&gt;, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Nausea and loss of appetite&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266_1_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266_1_&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Everyone loves pizza. Tim Boyle / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Marijuana users are likely familiar with the munchies, a strong desire to eat while under the influence. It should come as little surprise, then, that marijuana is a great way to treat nausea and loss of appetite, &lt;a href=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/IOM_Report.pdf&gt;according to the Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Treating these symptoms can play a pivotal role in recovering from a serious illness. Cancer patients, for example, often experience nausea and loss of appetite — and, as a result, rapid weight lost — during chemotherapy treatments. Getting these patients to eat healthy could speed up their recoveries, making it &lt;a href=http://www.webmd.com/cancer/features/eating-treatment&gt;a major interest&lt;/a&gt; among health experts.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242733/144995835_1_.jpg class=photo alt=144995835_1_&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could let you sleep like this red panda. Mark Ralston / AFP&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is a disorder that leads to shaking and difficulty with movement. It also often leads to pain and &lt;a href=http://www.everydayhealth.com/parkinsons-disease/sleeping-well-with-parkinsons-disease.aspx&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01278.x/abstract&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; concluded marijuana's psychoactive properties could be particularly suited to treat Parkinson's. &lt;a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614667&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found marijuana significantly improved pain and sleep issues among Parkinson's patients. Both studies advised more research, but their initial results were noted as positive.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242773/179789883.jpg class=photo alt=179789883&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could make this pain go away. BSIP / Universal Images Group&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — not to be mixed up with irritable bowel syndrome — is a painful, potentially life-threatening illness that involves chronic inflammation of a person's digestive tract. Crohn's disease is a severe form of IBD that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;IBD and Crohn's disease currently have no cure. Instead, &lt;a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage&gt;current treatments&lt;/a&gt; focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in &lt;a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512&gt;an extensive review&lt;/a&gt; of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;PTSD&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after moments of extreme emotional trauma. It's a well-recognized problem among military veterans, with no adequate pharmaceutical treatments.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Except perhaps marijuana. &lt;a href=http://communications.med.nyu.edu/media-relations/news/brain-imaging-study-links-cannabinoid-receptors-post-traumatic-stress-disorder&gt;A brain-imaging study&lt;/a&gt; concluded that marijuana's chemical properties seem particularly poised for addressing PTSD.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;&lt;span class=s2&gt;There’s a consensus among clinicians  that existing pharmaceutical treatments such as antidepressants simply  do not work, Alexander Neumeister, the study’s lead researcher, said in  a statement. In fact, we know very well that people with PTSD who use  marijuana — a potent cannabinoid — often experience more relief from  their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric  medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;It should come as little surprise, then, that the first person to buy recreational marijuana in Colorado was &lt;span class=s2&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-101660.html&gt;Sean Azzariti&lt;/a&gt;, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD. (Colorado law currently forbids treating PTSD with medical marijuana.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;Azzariti's example speaks to one problem often raised by supporters of medical marijuana: sometimes allowing marijuana for medical purposes isn't enough; it's important for advocates to push states to expand the drug's medical availability.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Epilepsy and seizures&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242877/698723.jpg class=photo alt=698723&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Researchers would like to give medical marijuana a deeper look. Michel Porro / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Although the scientific evidence is scarce, the Epilepsy Foundation &lt;a href=http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2014/2/epilepsy-foundation-calls-increased-medical-marijuana-access-and-research&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that medical marijuana should be opened up to patients with epilepsy and uncontrollable seizures.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=p3&gt;With medical marijuana spreading across the states, stories have trickled out claiming that marijuana helped solve people's struggles with epilepsy and seizures. A cancer patient, for example, &lt;a href=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-27741-healthy_hits.html&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; last year that taking marijuana eased her epilepsy, on top of her nausea and loss of appetite.&lt;span class=s2&gt; Without medical marijuana, I wouldn’t be alive today, she said. It really has changed my life for the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions. While this list is limited to six examples, it could certainly grow as legalization encourages doctors and researchers to take another look at a drug once marked as taboo.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td></tr>\n",

Century&lt;/i&gt; advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. &lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century&gt;You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book&lt;/a&gt;. But the argument &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;is built&lt;/span&gt; upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;tells&lt;/span&gt; many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;1) The fall and rise of Asia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png class=photo alt=World_output&gt;300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;2) The return of inequality in Britain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_britain&gt;This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;wealth&lt;/span&gt; was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;3) The return of inequality in Germany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_germany&gt;The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. &lt;span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark&gt;Instead wealth&lt;/span&gt; was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;4) America's age of equality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_the_united_states&gt;American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt; \\n&lt;div id=slaves&gt;&lt;span&gt;5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \\n&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United_states_with_slavery&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;6) The varieties of capitalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png class=photo alt=Market_value_and_book_value&gt;This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;7) The really really rich are different from you and me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png class=photo alt=Income_composition&gt;This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;8) Wealth is much more unequal than income&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth_inequality&gt;You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;much &lt;/i&gt;more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;9) The billionaires boom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td></tr>\n",

legalized recreational marijuana sales, Denver embraced the opportunity with open arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The city is now home to more than 62 percent of all Colorado recreational marijuana retailers, who cashed in on &lt;a href=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/colorado-marijuana-tax-revenue_n_4936223.html&gt;$14 million in sales&lt;/a&gt; in January alone.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other cities weren't so eager: heeding legalization opponents'  safety concerns, several pushed off licensing retail sales. Some banned  retail sales altogether.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There will be many harmful   consequences, Douglas County Sheriff David Weaver warned in a September 2012 statement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expect more  crime, more kids using marijuana, and pot for sale  everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=center&gt;Thugs put on masks, they come to your house, they kick in your door. They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana, give me your money.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;One California sheriff &lt;a href=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/02/11/sheriff-in-california-says-coloradans-will-regret-legalizing-marijuana/&gt;went on Denver television&lt;/a&gt; to warn that, as a result of marijuana in his county, thugs put on masks, they come to your house, they kick  in your door. They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana,  give me your money.'&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three months into its legalization experiment, Denver isn't seeing a  widespread rise in crime. Violent and property crimes actually decreased  slightly, and some cities are taking a second look at allowing  marijuana sales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We had folks, kind of doomsayers, saying, 'Oh my gosh, we're going  to have riots in the streets the day they open,' Denver City Council  President Mary Beth Susman, a supporter of legal marijuana, says. But  it was so quiet.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Denver's violent crime rate is holding steady&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=Violent_crime_in_denver class=photo src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262311/violent_crime_in_denver.png&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;/center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Denver's &lt;a href=http://www.denvergov.org/police/PoliceDepartment/CrimeInformation/CrimeStatisticsMaps/tabid/441370/Default.aspx&gt;crime data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows a slight decrease in the past year: violent crime in January and February fell by 2.4 percent compared to the first two months of 2013.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Property crime is falling, too&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262319/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_1.50.37_PM__1_.png class=photo alt=Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_1&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;/center&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prior to legalization, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23763821/denver-das-version-violent-medical-marijuana-industry-questioned&gt;opponents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b style=line-height: 1.5;&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;warned  property crime would rise. Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Three months is still a short time frame&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Gorman, director of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, &lt;a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. &lt;a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and &lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana&gt;medical marijuana&lt;/a&gt; legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, &lt;a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana&gt;issued guidances&lt;/a&gt; telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks &lt;a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx&gt;remain skeptical&lt;/a&gt; without changes in the law itself.)&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. &lt;a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Some cities aren't resisting this offer. Chris Hondros / Getty Images News&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After Denver's smooth transition, other major cities in Colorado now  appear ready to join. Aurora, the third most populous city in Colorado, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://kdvr.com/2014/03/26/aurora-to-enter-retail-marijuana-foray/&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to open recreational sales in October, even though medical sales remain  illegal through voter rule. And Fort Collins, the fourth most populous  city in the state, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20140318/NEWS01/303180076/Fort-Collins-council-gives-final-go-ahead-recreational-pot-stores&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to have applications ready for recreational dispensaries in early April.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;If Denver's experience holds true, the transition — at least for the first few months — should go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </span></td></tr>\n",

sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a &lt;a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/&gt;prediction&lt;/a&gt; that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But &lt;a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/&gt;not one of them&lt;/a&gt; had given up.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obamacare's March madness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the &lt;i&gt;entire &lt;/i&gt;month of October.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. &lt;span&gt;California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector_enrollment.png alt=Connector_enrollment&gt;&lt;span&gt;But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h4&gt;Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance&lt;/h4&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p dir=ltr&gt;&lt;span&gt;On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p dir=ltr&gt;But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p dir=ltr&gt;That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says.

                               </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>&lt;p&gt;For the past six months, the best Obamacare sign-up data hasn't come from a Washington think-tank or Health and Human Services number-crunchers.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The best, most granular accounting of Obamacare's sign-ups happens in a messy bedroom-turned-office in Michigan where Charles Gaba runs&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/&gt;ACASignups.Net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=center&gt;Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba is a 43-year-old web developer who lives in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=Charles_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p class=caption&gt;Charles Gaba&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as &lt;a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/&gt;the invaluable Charles Gaba&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png class=photo alt=State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions&gt;&lt;br id=1396567685947&gt; It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law &amp;mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=right&gt;Most people who tried to track enrollment &amp;mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &amp;mdash; gave up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Most people who tried to track enrollment &amp;mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &amp;mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day &amp;mdash; one before work, one after &amp;mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;'&lt;span&gt;For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'&lt;/span&gt;\\n&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups &amp;mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors &amp;mdash; announced prominently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=left&gt;I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;div&gt;Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. &lt;span&gt;The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. &lt;/span&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt; \\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In January, Gaba &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;&gt;projected &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I'm getting a little nervous.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers &amp;mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March &amp;mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.&lt;/p&gt; \\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on. I think, hopefully, the site will have served its function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td></tr>\n",

kind to<span> </span><a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;>Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly \\$1,000 in January before falling to around \\$350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=right><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969.

But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf>hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=left><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>People have been <a target=\\_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world>building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target=\\_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/>329 of them</a>.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323\\_4c41d3ef76\\_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323\\_4c41d3ef76\\_b></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;>401(K) 2013</a></p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590>happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p>\\\\\n",

At least <a href=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/182/14/E694.abstract>two</a> <a href=https://www.neurology.org/content/68/7/515.abstract>studies</a> found marijuana can successfully treat different kinds of pain, including a difficult-to-treat kind called neuropathic pain and pain among HIV/AIDS patients.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The major advantage to marijuana as a painkiller is it could reduce reliance on more addictive, dangerous opiates. One study <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225>concluded</a> that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering <a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills>how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse</a>, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Nausea and loss of appetite</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266\\_1\\_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266\\_1\\_></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Everyone loves pizza.

Instead, <a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage>current treatments</a> focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372>a recent study</a> found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in <a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512>an extensive review</a> of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>PTSD</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD.

It really has changed my life for the better.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions.

advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century>You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World\\_Output.png class=photo alt=World\\_output>300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital\\_in\\_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital\\_in\\_britain>This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital\\_in\\_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital\\_in\\_germany>The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=GINGER\\_SOFTWARE\\_mark>Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States.png class=photo alt=Capital\\_in\\_the\\_united\\_states>American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3> \\textbackslash{}n<div id=slaves><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \\textbackslash{}n</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United\\_States\\_With\\_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United\\_states\\_with\\_slavery></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market\\_value\\_and\\_book\\_value.png class=photo alt=Market\\_value\\_and\\_book\\_value>This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income\\_composition.png class=photo alt=Income\\_composition>This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth\\_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth\\_inequality>You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span> </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/>told CNN</a> that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info\\%3Adoi\\%2F10.1371\\%2Fjournal.pone.0092816>One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana>medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana>issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx>remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996>One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get \\$20 to \\$100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get \\$30,000 in cash.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>A grow operation will have a \\$20,000 or \\$30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  \\$20,000 or \\$30,000 in a briefcase.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Some cities aren't resisting this offer.

Obamacare hit 8 million sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.</q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/>prediction</a> that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/>not one of them</a> had given up.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><br>People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>Obamacare's March madness</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the <i>entire </i>month of October.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. <span>California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q>15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.</q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector\\_enrollment.png alt=Connector\\_enrollment><span>But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h4>Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance</h4> \\textbackslash{}n<p>There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p dir=ltr><span>On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p dir=ltr>But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p dir=ltr>That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says. But that they would stick through so much hassle still amazes us.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

\\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba is a 43-year-old web developer who lives in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img alt=Charles\\_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles\\_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p class=caption>Charles Gaba</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as <a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/>the invaluable Charles Gaba</a>.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. </span><span>Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.</span><span> Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state\\_health\\_insurance\\_exchange\\_decisions.png class=photo alt=State\\_health\\_insurance\\_exchange\\_decisions><br id=1396567685947> It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law \\&mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=right>Most people who tried to track enrollment \\&mdash; and weren't doing it for a living \\&mdash; gave up</q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Most people who tried to track enrollment \\&mdash; and weren't doing it for a living \\&mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day \\&mdash; one before work, one after \\&mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3>'<span>For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'</span>\\textbackslash{}n</h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from\\&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k>South Carolina</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k>New York</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts>Maryland</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension>Nevada</a><span>, </span><span>and </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers>California</a><span>. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. </span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups \\&mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors \\&mdash; announced prominently.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><q class=left>I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going </q></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<div>Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. <span>The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. </span>\\textbackslash{}n</div> \\textbackslash{}n<div><br></div> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>In January, Gaba </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: \\#ffffff; line-height: 1.5;>projected </a><span>that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<h3><span>'I'm getting a little nervous.'</span></h3> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers \\&mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. </span><span>I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.</span></p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p>Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March \\&mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.</p> \\textbackslash{}n<p><span>It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on.

markets haven't been kind to<span> </span><a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;>Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \\n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \\n<p><q class=right><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \\n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \\n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \\n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \\n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp></p> \\n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \\n<p class=caption>This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969.

But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \\n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf>hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \\n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \\n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \\n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \\n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \\n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \\n<p><q class=left><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \\n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \\n<p>People have been <a target=_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world>building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target=_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/>329 of them</a>.</p> \\n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \\n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.</p> \\n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \\n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \\n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b></p> \\n<p class=caption><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;>401(K) 2013</a></p> \\n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \\n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \\n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \\n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \\n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \\n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \\n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590>happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \\n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \\n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \\n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p> | \n",

<p>Twenty states have so far legalized the medical use of marijuana, and researchers are starting to look at how, exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.</p> \\n<p>There's a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat — and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine. But the evidence remains quite limited, largely as a result of prohibition and strict federal oversight of medical research.</p> \\n<p>Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it, says Sue Sisley, a doctor and researcher at the University of Arizona. It is negligent for these 20 states to go selling cards to marijuana patients without actively conducting rigorous medical marijuana research that's necessary.</p> \\n<p><q class=center>Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it</q></p> \\n<p>Sisley wants to study marijuana as a treatment for military veterans with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), but it took until March — <a href=http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/timeline/>nearly four years after the study's conception</a> — for the study to get federal approval. First, she needed the Food and Drug Administration to sign off. Then, her team waited three years for approval from the Public Health Service to obtain legal marijuana supplies. <span>(No other </span><a href=http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ds.shtml>schedule 1 drug</a><span> </span><span>needs the extra round of approval,</span><span> </span><a href=http://www.maps.org/media/view/press_release_public_health_service_blocks_fda-approved_medical_mariju/>according to Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a><span>.)</span></p> \\n<p>It's a long process, Sisley says. And we believe the only reason we got the Public Health Service approval, finally, was because of really strong advocacy from our veterans all over the country who were asking the federal government why they were blocking this research.</p> \\n<p><span></span><span>Despite the difficulties, some marijuana research managed to get approval in the United States and other countries over the past few years.

Anadolu Agency</p> \\n<p>Among the most obvious medical qualities of marijuana is its use as a painkiller. At least <a href=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/182/14/E694.abstract>two</a> <a href=https://www.neurology.org/content/68/7/515.abstract>studies</a> found marijuana can successfully treat different kinds of pain, including a difficult-to-treat kind called neuropathic pain and pain among HIV/AIDS patients.</p> \\n<p>The major advantage to marijuana as a painkiller is it could reduce reliance on more addictive, dangerous opiates. One study <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225>concluded</a> that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering <a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills>how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse</a>, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.</p> \\n<h3>Nausea and loss of appetite</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266_1_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266_1_></p> \\n<p class=caption>Everyone loves pizza. Tim Boyle / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Marijuana users are likely familiar with the munchies, a strong desire to eat while under the influence. It should come as little surprise, then, that marijuana is a great way to treat nausea and loss of appetite, <a href=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/IOM_Report.pdf>according to the Institute of Medicine</a>.</p> \\n<p>Treating these symptoms can play a pivotal role in recovering from a serious illness. Cancer patients, for example, often experience nausea and loss of appetite — and, as a result, rapid weight lost — during chemotherapy treatments. Getting these patients to eat healthy could speed up their recoveries, making it <a href=http://www.webmd.com/cancer/features/eating-treatment>a major interest</a> among health experts.</p> \\n<h3>Parkinson's disease</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242733/144995835_1_.jpg class=photo alt=144995835_1_></p> \\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could let you sleep like this red panda. Mark Ralston / AFP</p> \\n<p>Parkinson's disease is a disorder that leads to shaking and difficulty with movement. It also often leads to pain and <a href=http://www.everydayhealth.com/parkinsons-disease/sleeping-well-with-parkinsons-disease.aspx>sleep deprivation</a>.</p> \\n<p><a href=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01278.x/abstract>One study</a> concluded marijuana's psychoactive properties could be particularly suited to treat Parkinson's. <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614667>Another study</a> found marijuana significantly improved pain and sleep issues among Parkinson's patients. Both studies advised more research, but their initial results were noted as positive.</p> \\n<h3>Inflammatory bowel disease</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242773/179789883.jpg class=photo alt=179789883></p> \\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could make this pain go away. BSIP / Universal Images Group</p> \\n<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — not to be mixed up with irritable bowel syndrome — is a painful, potentially life-threatening illness that involves chronic inflammation of a person's digestive tract. Crohn's disease is a severe form of IBD that can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and malnutrition.</p> \\n<p>IBD and Crohn's disease currently have no cure. Instead, <a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage>current treatments</a> focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.</p> \\n<p>But <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372>a recent study</a> found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in <a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512>an extensive review</a> of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.</p> \\n<h3>PTSD</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241></p> \\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after moments of extreme emotional trauma. It's a well-recognized problem among military veterans, with no adequate pharmaceutical treatments.</p> \\n<p>Except perhaps marijuana. <a href=http://communications.med.nyu.edu/media-relations/news/brain-imaging-study-links-cannabinoid-receptors-post-traumatic-stress-disorder>A brain-imaging study</a> concluded that marijuana's chemical properties seem particularly poised for addressing PTSD.</p> \\n<p class=p3><span class=s2>There’s a consensus among clinicians  that existing pharmaceutical treatments such as antidepressants simply  do not work, Alexander Neumeister, the study’s lead researcher, said in  a statement. In fact, we know very well that people with PTSD who use  marijuana — a potent cannabinoid — often experience more relief from  their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric  medications.</span></p> \\n<p class=p3>It should come as little surprise, then, that the first person to buy recreational marijuana in Colorado was <span class=s2><a href=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-101660.html>Sean Azzariti</a>, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD. (Colorado law currently forbids treating PTSD with medical marijuana.)</span></p> \\n<p class=p3>Azzariti's example speaks to one problem often raised by supporters of medical marijuana: sometimes allowing marijuana for medical purposes isn't enough; it's important for advocates to push states to expand the drug's medical availability.</p> \\n<h3>Epilepsy and seizures</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242877/698723.jpg class=photo alt=698723></p> \\n<p class=caption>Researchers would like to give medical marijuana a deeper look. Michel Porro / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Although the scientific evidence is scarce, the Epilepsy Foundation <a href=http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2014/2/epilepsy-foundation-calls-increased-medical-marijuana-access-and-research>argues</a> that medical marijuana should be opened up to patients with epilepsy and uncontrollable seizures.</p> \\n<p class=p3>With medical marijuana spreading across the states, stories have trickled out claiming that marijuana helped solve people's struggles with epilepsy and seizures. A cancer patient, for example, <a href=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-27741-healthy_hits.html>told me</a> last year that taking marijuana eased her epilepsy, on top of her nausea and loss of appetite.<span class=s2> Without medical marijuana, I wouldn’t be alive today, she said. It really has changed my life for the better.</span></p> \\n<p>Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.</p> \\n<p>The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions. While this list is limited to six examples, it could certainly grow as legalization encourages doctors and researchers to take another look at a drug once marked as taboo.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \n",

Piketty's book <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i> advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century>You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \\n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png class=photo alt=World_output>300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \\n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_britain>This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \\n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_germany>The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \\n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_the_united_states>American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \\n<h3> \\n<div id=slaves><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \\n</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United_states_with_slavery></p> \\n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \\n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png class=photo alt=Market_value_and_book_value>This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \\n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png class=photo alt=Income_composition>This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \\n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth_inequality>You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \\n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires></p> \\n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | \n",

They point guns at you and say, 'Give me your marijuana,  give me your money.'</p> \\n<p><span>Three months into its legalization experiment, Denver isn't seeing a  widespread rise in crime. Violent and property crimes actually decreased  slightly, and some cities are taking a second look at allowing  marijuana sales.</span></p> \\n<p>We had folks, kind of doomsayers, saying, 'Oh my gosh, we're going  to have riots in the streets the day they open,' Denver City Council  President Mary Beth Susman, a supporter of legal marijuana, says. But  it was so quiet.</p> \\n<h3>Denver's violent crime rate is holding steady</h3> \\n<center> \\n<p><img alt=Violent_crime_in_denver class=photo src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262311/violent_crime_in_denver.png></p> \\n</center> \\n<p>Denver's <a href=http://www.denvergov.org/police/PoliceDepartment/CrimeInformation/CrimeStatisticsMaps/tabid/441370/Default.aspx>crime data</a><span> shows a slight decrease in the past year: violent crime in January and February fell by 2.4 percent compared to the first two months of 2013.</span></p> \\n<h3>Property crime is falling, too</h3> \\n<center> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4262319/Screen_Shot_2014-04-04_at_1.50.37_PM__1_.png class=photo alt=Screen_shot_2014-04-04_at_1></p> \\n</center> \\n<p><span>Prior to legalization, </span><a href=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23763821/denver-das-version-violent-medical-marijuana-industry-questioned>opponents</a><b style=line-height: 1.5;> </b><span>warned  property crime would rise. Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). </span></p> \\n<p>So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \\n<p>Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \\n<p>Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.</p> \\n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \\n<p><span> </span></p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349></p> \\n<p class=caption>Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \\n<p>We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.</p> \\n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \\n<p>This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.</p> \\n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/>told CNN</a> that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.</p> \\n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962></p> \\n<p class=caption>Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816>One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana>medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \\n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.</p> \\n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.</p> \\n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \\n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883></p> \\n<p class=caption>People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \\n<p>If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \\n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana>issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx>remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \\n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996>One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \\n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash.</p> \\n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \\n<p>A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase.</p> \\n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840></p> \\n<p class=caption>Some cities aren't resisting this offer.

simple reason that Obamacare hit 8 million sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.</p> \\n<p>But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.</p> \\n<p><q>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.</q></p> \\n<p>Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/>prediction</a> that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/>not one of them</a> had given up.</p> \\n<p>I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.</p> \\n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \\n<p>If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.</p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment></p> \\n<p><br>People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.</p> \\n<h3><span>Obamacare's March madness</span></h3> \\n<p>Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the <i>entire </i>month of October.</p> \\n<p><span>Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.</span></p> \\n<p>The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. <span>California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. </span></p> \\n<p><q>15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.</q></p> \\n<p>For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.</p> \\n<p><span>This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.</span></p> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector_enrollment.png alt=Connector_enrollment><span>But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.</span></p> \\n<p>It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.</p> \\n<h4>Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance</h4> \\n<p>There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.</p> \\n<p>We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.</p> \\n<p>They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.</p> \\n<p><span>The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.</span></p> \\n<p dir=ltr><span>On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.</span></p> \\n<p dir=ltr>But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.</p> \\n<p dir=ltr>That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says. But that they would stick through so much hassle still amazes us.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | \n",

past six months, the best Obamacare sign-up data hasn't come from a Washington think-tank or Health and Human Services number-crunchers.</p> \\n<p>The best, most granular accounting of Obamacare's sign-ups happens in a messy bedroom-turned-office in Michigan where Charles Gaba runs&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/>ACASignups.Net</a>.</p> \\n<p><q class=center>Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data</q></p> \\n<p>Gaba is a 43-year-old web developer who lives in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.</p> \\n<p><img alt=Charles_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center></p> \\n<p class=caption>Charles Gaba</p> \\n<p><span>But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.</span></p> \\n<p>Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as <a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/>the invaluable Charles Gaba</a>.</p> \\n<p><span>Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. </span><span>Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.</span><span> Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.</span></p> \\n<p>At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.</p> \\n<h3>'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'</h3> \\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png class=photo alt=State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions><br id=1396567685947> It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law &mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.</p> \\n<p>Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.</p> \\n<p>But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.</p> \\n<p><q class=right>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up</q></p> \\n<p><span>The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.</span></p> \\n<p>Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.</p> \\n<p>We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.</p> \\n<p>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.</p> \\n<p>You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day &mdash; one before work, one after &mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.</p> \\n<p>At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.</p> \\n<h3>'<span>For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'</span>\\n</h3> \\n<p>There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k>South Carolina</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k>New York</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts>Maryland</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension>Nevada</a><span>, </span><span>and </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers>California</a><span>. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. </span></p> \\n<p>The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.</p> \\n<p><span>The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups &mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors &mdash; announced prominently.</span></p> \\n<p><q class=left>I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going </q></p> \\n<p>The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.</p> \\n<p>It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.</p> \\n<div>Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. <span>The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. </span>\\n</div> \\n<div><br></div> \\n<p><span>In January, Gaba </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;>projected </a><span>that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.</span></p> \\n<p>For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.</p> \\n<p>This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.</p> \\n<h3><span>'I'm getting a little nervous.'</span></h3> \\n<p>Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers &mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.</p> \\n<p><span>My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. </span><span>I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.</span></p> \\n<p>We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).</p> \\n<p>I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.</p> \\n<p>Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March &mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.</p> \\n<p><span>It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on. I think, hopefully, the site will have served its function.</span></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \n",

       "1 <p>The markets haven't been kind to<span> </span><a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/ style=font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;>Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \\\\n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey're accepted everywhere, they're convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \\\\n<p><q class=right><span>Bitcoin's detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \\\\n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it's a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it's the world's first completely open financial network.</span></p> \\\\n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn't seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \\\\n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet's power while shielding users from its complexity. <span>You don't have to be an expert on the internet's TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin's currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg class=photo alt=Imp></p> \\\\n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969. (Flickr/<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294438012/>FastLizard4</a>)</p> \\\\n<p><span></span></p> \\\\n<h3><span>The first open financial network</span></h3> \\\\n<p>The Bitcoin network serves the same purpose as mainstream payment networks such as Visa or Western Union. But there's an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \\\\n<p>And that's not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with <a href=https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf>hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won't let you do on its network at all.</p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there's a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \\\\n<p>There's an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \\\\n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn't need to ask anyone's permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \\\\n<h3>Finding Bitcoin's killer app</h3> \\\\n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It's hard to predict tomorrow's innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin's potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \\\\n<p><q class=left><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \\\\n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \\\\n<p>People have been <a target=_blank href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world>building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are <a target=_blank href=http://coinatmradar.com/>329 of them</a>.</p> \\\\n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That's comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \\\\n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don't have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as chargebacks.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that's going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin's volatility.</span></p> \\\\n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it's approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \\\\n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren't otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg class=photo alt=6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b></p> \\\\n<p class=caption><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l style=font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;>401(K) 2013</a></p> \\\\n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \\\\n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin's volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin wallet apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \\\\n<p>Fortunately, it's possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don't expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin's value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant's conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant's perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn't affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user's cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user's perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \\\\n<p>You're probably wondering: if Bitcoin's value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \\\\n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there's no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that's exactly what <a href=http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590>happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin's openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there's no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \\\\n<p>Many of Bitcoin's early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul's brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn't have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It's worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul's views on the Federal Reserve.</p>\n",
       "2 <p>Twenty states have so far legalized the medical use of marijuana, and researchers are starting to look at how, exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.</p> \\\\n<p>There's a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat — and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine. But the evidence remains quite limited, largely as a result of prohibition and strict federal oversight of medical research.</p> \\\\n<p>Millions of patients are using this plant, and we need to understand it, says Sue Sisley, a doctor and researcher at the University of Arizona.

One study <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22048225>concluded</a> that marijuana use allowed patients with pain to reduce their opiate use. Considering <a href=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116922/what-makes-heroin-crisis-different-doctor-prescribed-pills>how doctor's prescriptions play into opiate abuse</a>, marijuana as a painkiller could produce sweeping public health benefits by limiting the pathways to abuse.</p> \\\\n<h3>Nausea and loss of appetite</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242741/3450266_1_.jpg class=photo alt=3450266_1_></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Everyone loves pizza.

Instead, <a href=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/crohns-disease-54-tips-to-help-you-manage>current treatments</a> focus on prolonging remission periods for as long as possible.</p> \\\\n<p>But <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23648372>a recent study</a> found marijuana produced significant, steroid-free benefits for Crohn's disease patients with no side effects. The study, admittedly, used a small sample size and called for more research. But in <a href=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512>an extensive review</a> of the study, other researchers concluded that the study's findings live up to the historical and scientific expectations normally attached to marijuana as a treatment for IBD.</p> \\\\n<h3>PTSD</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242829/141948241.jpg class=photo alt=141948241></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Marijuana could block receptors in the brain that cause PTSD. Dan Kitwood / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after moments of extreme emotional trauma. It's a well-recognized problem among military veterans, with no adequate pharmaceutical treatments.</p> \\\\n<p>Except perhaps marijuana. <a href=http://communications.med.nyu.edu/media-relations/news/brain-imaging-study-links-cannabinoid-receptors-post-traumatic-stress-disorder>A brain-imaging study</a> concluded that marijuana's chemical properties seem particularly poised for addressing PTSD.</p> \\\\n<p class=p3><span class=s2>There’s a consensus among clinicians  that existing pharmaceutical treatments such as antidepressants simply  do not work, Alexander Neumeister, the study’s lead researcher, said in  a statement. In fact, we know very well that people with PTSD who use  marijuana — a potent cannabinoid — often experience more relief from  their symptoms than they do from antidepressants and other psychiatric  medications.</span></p> \\\\n<p class=p3>It should come as little surprise, then, that the first person to buy recreational marijuana in Colorado was <span class=s2><a href=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/legal-recreational-pot-industry-opens-in-colorado-101660.html>Sean Azzariti</a>, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD. (Colorado law currently forbids treating PTSD with medical marijuana.)</span></p> \\\\n<p class=p3>Azzariti's example speaks to one problem often raised by supporters of medical marijuana: sometimes allowing marijuana for medical purposes isn't enough; it's important for advocates to push states to expand the drug's medical availability.</p> \\\\n<h3>Epilepsy and seizures</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4242877/698723.jpg class=photo alt=698723></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Researchers would like to give medical marijuana a deeper look. Michel Porro / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Although the scientific evidence is scarce, the Epilepsy Foundation <a href=http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2014/2/epilepsy-foundation-calls-increased-medical-marijuana-access-and-research>argues</a> that medical marijuana should be opened up to patients with epilepsy and uncontrollable seizures.</p> \\\\n<p class=p3>With medical marijuana spreading across the states, stories have trickled out claiming that marijuana helped solve people's struggles with epilepsy and seizures. A cancer patient, for example, <a href=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-27741-healthy_hits.html>told me</a> last year that taking marijuana eased her epilepsy, on top of her nausea and loss of appetite.<span class=s2> Without medical marijuana, I wouldn’t be alive today, she said. It really has changed my life for the better.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Still, the scientific evidence remains limited to animal trials. At the center of the issue is the federal government's restrictions on marijuana-related clinical research. The Epilepsy Foundation argues the Drug Enforcement Agency should relax its classification for marijuana, which is currently marked as more dangerous than cocaine, to support more research.</p> \\\\n<p>The problem isn't limited to just epilepsy, however. It's long been difficult to study marijuana due to federal restrictions. While this list is limited to six examples, it could certainly grow as legalization encourages doctors and researchers to take another look at a drug once marked as taboo.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3 <p>Thomas Piketty's book <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i> advances an important and provocative argument about the future of the world economy. <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century>You can read all about it here in our short guide to the book</a>. But the argument <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png class=photo alt=World_output>300 years ago, a majority of the world's economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe's share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia's share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent's enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia's staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn't yet back to where it was in 1714 but it's getting close.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_britain>This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by net foreign capital, i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses—primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_germany>The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. Net foreign capital, meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark>Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by other domestic capital, meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it's rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany's vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>4) America's age of equality</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png class=photo alt=Capital_in_the_united_states>American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America's enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \\\\n<h3> \\\\n<div id=slaves><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \\\\n</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png class=photo alt=United_states_with_slavery></p> \\\\n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png class=photo alt=Market_value_and_book_value>This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it's very deep. For several different countries, it compares the market value of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the book value of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png class=photo alt=Income_composition>This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do — they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income — wages and salaries — are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don't get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png class=photo alt=Wealth_inequality>You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png class=photo alt=Billionaires></p> \\\\n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster — over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Denver District Attorney Mitch  Morrissey argued robbers would prey on marijuana businesses  and their customers, because they're more likely to carry cash (and, of course, the drug). </span></p> \\\\n<p>So far, city data shows no increase in property  crime. Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \\\\n<p>Denver residents don't seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \\\\n<p>Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum, Susman says.</p> \\\\n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \\\\n<p><span> </span></p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg class=photo alt=459964349></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Some groups caution that it's too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \\\\n<p>We quite frankly don't know, Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. We've had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It's a pretty  short window.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won't surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \\\\n<p>This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana, Gorman says. Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.</p> \\\\n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href=http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/>told CNN</a> that the city's dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  nothing that has raised a major red flag.</p> \\\\n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn't led to an increase in crime</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg class=photo alt=98049962></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816>One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href=http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana>medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \\\\n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. Perhaps there's additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with, he says.</p> \\\\n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. We know there's a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence, Morris says. There's not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.</p> \\\\n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don't necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \\\\n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses' cash holdings</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg class=photo alt=143182883></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>If there's a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \\\\n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash — sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars — from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana>issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href=http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx>remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \\\\n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href=http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996>One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \\\\n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100, he said in an interview. You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash.</p> \\\\n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \\\\n<p>A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month, she says. They have to show up at the utility's office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase.</p> \\\\n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver's lead</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg class=photo alt=98555840></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Some cities aren't resisting this offer.

       "5 <p>There's a very simple reason that Obamacare hit 8 million sign-ups: Being uninsured is horrible.</p> \\\\n<p>But the political conversation over Obamacare was driven almost entirely by people who had, and knew they would be able to keep, their health insurance. It was filled with a lot of assumptions, theories, and speculations about what people who didn't have good insurance, or any insurance, would do. And after Obamacare's disastrous launch, the theory took hold that these people wouldn't find this untested program worth the trouble. It was the permanently insured speculating about the uninsured and the barely insured – and, unsurprisingly, they got it wrong.</p> \\\\n<p><q>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. It's worse to be uninsured.</q></p> \\\\n<p>Back in December, when the web site's woes were fresh in everyone's mind, I made a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/>prediction</a> that sounded strange even to me: Obamacare might still hit its 7 million enrollees. The reason I made that prediction was I'd been talking to the uninsured who'd been spending hours or days or weeks trying to get through the web site. They were frustrated and they were angry. But <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/its-hard-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-its-much-worse-to-be-uninsured/>not one of them</a> had given up.</p> \\\\n<p>I asked pollsters Mike Perry and Tresa Undem, who specialized in surveying the uninsured, whether they had found anyone who'd been deterred by the unusable web site and overloaded call centers. Not even one person, they said. The persistence was amazing.</p> \\\\n<p>It was hard to sign up for Obamacare. But what too many insured pundits forgot is it's much worse to be uninsured, or underinsured. And that's true, too, for the people who saw their plans canceled by Obamacare and then needed to decide whether to sign up for a new one.</p> \\\\n<p>If you live in my world, you have done or read study after study how much the uninsured want health insurance and why they want it, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. So you just had to believe they would give it a serious try.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4316117/enrollment.png class=photo alt=Enrollment></p> \\\\n<p><br>People did give it a serious try. And when the site failed them, they waited a few months and gave it another serious try. In March and April, 3.7 million people signed up for coverage, three times as many as the White House had expected.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>Obamacare's March madness</span></h3> \\\\n<p>Over 217,000 people signed up for Obamacare on the very last day March, more than double all sign-ups in the <i>entire </i>month of October.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Specific states saw similar figures, some more dramatic: In the District of Columbia, for example, one-quarter of all people who signed up did so in the last week of March.</span></p> \\\\n<p>The sign-up surge appears to have continued into April, after the Obama administration gave shoppers who started the enrollment process by the end of March two additional weeks to finish. <span>California announced Thursday that 205,000 people signed up for coverage between April 1 and 15. That accounts for 15 percent of the 1.3 million people who signed up for coverage there. </span></p> \\\\n<p><q>15 percent of california's 1.3 million sign-ups happened in april.</q></p> \\\\n<p>For a lot of people health insurance is far from their favorite thing in life, Kaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman says. I think the huge volume at the very end is just as much about how Americans do stuff and procrastinate, as it is about the health care law.</p> \\\\n<p><span>This doesn't come as a total surprise; about a quarter of Americans file their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service in the two weeks before the deadline. Massachusetts saw a spike(although not as big) in enrollment during its law's first enrollment period, in 2007.</span></p> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4223015/connector_enrollment.png alt=Connector_enrollment><span>But even knowing that deadlines tend to motivate action, nobody expected how much action would happen in March.</span></p> \\\\n<p>It made more sense though if you spent much time talking to people about health insurance. They don't like trying to sign up for it. It's complex and it's intimidating and it's expensive. But buying insurance isn't nearly as bad as being uninsured.</p> \\\\n<h4>Obamacare shoppers really, really wanted health insurance</h4> \\\\n<p>There were many obstacles standing in between health law shoppers and buying insurance coverage. This was partially technical failures that could have been avoided. But there was also the fact that most people don't understand health insurance, or have much experience shopping for it. People have trouble defining key insurance terms, things like co-insurance and deductible.</p> \\\\n<p>We made enrollment so much harder than it needed to be, says Mike Perry, a founder of polling firm PerryUndem, which has conducted numerous focus group with uninsured Americans. There was a knowledge gap, there were glitches, most people didn't know about financial assistance or navigators. We had so many hurdles and yet they persevered.</p> \\\\n<p>They persevered because it's horrible to be uninsured. When Perry and his co-founder Tresa Undem conducted focus groups, they didn't hear a lot of I give up when the uninsured ran into obstacles. Instead, it was a lot more of I'll try again later.</p> \\\\n<p><span>The health-care law beat its mark because it was selling something 8 million people want to buy.</span></p> \\\\n<p dir=ltr><span>On a policy level, beating the 7 million number isn't especially meaningful for the Affordable Care Act. It's a political yardstick that doesn't measure how many healthy people, for example, are signing up, a crucial factor for determining whether premiums go up next year. There's nothing magical about beating 7 million enrollees.</span></p> \\\\n<p dir=ltr>But even if the total number of Obamacare sign-ups isn't especially important, the groundswell of enrollments is: it shows that the fundamental premise of the law -- that people want health insurance -- is correct. They're willing to battle through a crummy website and a complicated law and endless political controversy in that process, too, if it means coming out with a health insurance policy at the end.</p> \\\\n<p dir=ltr>That's not a new idea that people want health insurance, Perry says. But that they would stick through so much hassle still amazes us.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

He's an Obamacare supporter but one who finds the health insurance industry ungodly boring. His eyes used to glaze over when his father, a doctor, would start talking HMOs and PPOs.</p> \\\\n<p><img alt=Charles_gaba01 class=photo src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4237687/charles_gaba01.jpg width=300 align=center></p> \\\\n<p class=caption>Charles Gaba</p> \\\\n<p><span>But for some reason, he became interested in the Obamacare enrollment numbers and has spent six months tracking them obsessively. He usually does so at night, after his 8-year-old son has gone to sleep. And with no background in health policy whatsoever, Gaba built the country's most trusted source of Affordable Care Act enrollment data.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Gaba's enrollment counts are routinely more up-to-date than the federal government's, which is why they turn up on newspaper front pages and cable news shows. Paul Krugman has described him as <a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/the-aca-surge-blackout/>the invaluable Charles Gaba</a>.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Gaba became well-known because he did something that, on the surface, seemed easy: He counted the Obamacare sign-ups. </span><span>Lots of other people (myself included) tried to do this, and failed.</span><span> Figuring out how many people have enrolled in Obamacare turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task.</span></p> \\\\n<p>At a certain point, and I'm not sure when, I just kind of became the guy doing this, Gaba said in a recent interview. I started to feel obligated to keep going.</p> \\\\n<h3>'Sixteen different, moving sources of information.'</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4195221/state_health_insurance_exchange_decisions.png class=photo alt=State_health_insurance_exchange_decisions><br id=1396567685947> It was hard to anticipate how challenging it would be to keep track of Obamacare's sign-ups. Massachusetts' coverage expansion 2007 is usually the closest analog for predicting the health care law &mdash; but there you had one state tracking enrollment, not dozens.</p> \\\\n<p>Prior to open enrollment's start, Health and Human Services had never committed to a particular plan for releasing information. They eventually settled on monthly data releases, which left lots of space between each data dump.</p> \\\\n<p>But that was just for the 36 states where the federal government was running Healthcare.gov. There were another 15 marketplaces run by states and the District of Columbia who, as early as October, started releasing sporadic data.</p> \\\\n<p><q class=right>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up</q></p> \\\\n<p><span>The challenge, on the exchange side, is you've got 14 states, the District of Columbia, and the feds all reporting different information at different times, says Caroline Pearson of Avalere Health, a research firm. You've got 16 different moving sources of information. It's on different websites, states are tweeting it. It gets released in different formats that are all over the place.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Even the information that states spewed out was different. Some states, like Washington, included a breakdown of which shoppers had paid their first month's premium and who hadn't.  Most states, and the federal government, didn't provide that granular data, instead releasing a lump sum of customers who had and hadn't paid for the plans they selected.</p> \\\\n<p>We generally try to use the data from the carriers and states to come up with a reasonable assumption of who has paid and who hasn't, Pearson says.</p> \\\\n<p>Most people who tried to track enrollment &mdash; and weren't doing it for a living &mdash; gave up. It was too time-consuming; just when you thought you'd collected the most current data, another state would publish something even newer.</p> \\\\n<p>You have 16 state exchanges that don't always keep to a schedule, says Aaron Strauss, who tried tracking enrollment in early October. He estimated he would spend about two hours a day &mdash; one before work, one after &mdash; trying to check in on more than a dozen state-run marketplaces.</p> \\\\n<p>At Avalere, Pearson has a team of 26 people working for her who try to keep tabs on state enrollment data and sort out issues like this. Gaba, on the other hand, is a team of one.</p> \\\\n<h3>'<span>For January, I ended up being off by about 500 people.'</span>\\\\n</h3> \\\\n<p>There are arguably three things that set Gaba's site apart from others. The first is the speed: In a given day, Gaba will post enrollment reports from&nbsp;<a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/south-carolina-qhps-76k>South Carolina</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/new-york-shop-qhps-double-5k-10k>New York</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/maryland-abandoning-their-exchange-replacing-it-connecticuts>Maryland</a><span>, </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/nevada-qhps-1k-322-xerox-thinks-theyll-complete-57k-during-extension>Nevada</a><span>, </span><span>and </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/29/california-suggestions-even-larger-numbers>California</a><span>. He'll work those into his spreadsheet and come up with new projections of, nationally, how many people have enrolled that day. He says he relies on a robust network of tipsters, who have sent in stories and state-level updates on a regular basis. </span></p> \\\\n<p>The spreadsheet tells me what the average has been and I can extrapolate out nationally, he says. So if I have data for 10 states for the first 10 days of March, I have a good idea of national sign ups.</p> \\\\n<p><span>The second is transparency: Every data point comes with a link, with every decision about how to count sign-ups &mdash; or retraction of data later found to have errors &mdash; announced prominently.</span></p> \\\\n<p><q class=left>I just kind of became the guy doing this. I started to feel obligated to keep going </q></p> \\\\n<p>The last distinction is a sort of simplicity to his work. Gaba only tracks the number of people who pick an insurance plan on the exchange. He does, for example not attempt to estimate the percent of people who have paid for their insurance plans, a space where data is still sparse. This has drawn some criticism from Obamacare opponents, who argue paid accounts is a better way to measure who is actually gaining coverage through Healthcare.gov.</p> \\\\n<p>It's a legitimate question and there's nothing wrong with asking, Gaba says. But it's not the thing that I'm tracking.</p> \\\\n<div>Gaba's obsessive data collection has led to remarkably accurate data projection. <span>The Obama administration won't release estimates of daily sign-up totals; Gaba will, and does quite well. </span>\\\\n</div> \\\\n<div><br></div> \\\\n<p><span>In January, Gaba </span><a href=http://acasignups.net/14/03/11/february-hhs-enrollment-report-released-943k-qhps-4242m-total style=background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;>projected </a><span>that Obamacare would hit 3.3 million sign ups. The actual number, released by the Obama administration five days later, was 3.299 million. His February projection was 4.2 percent off from the final-sign tally.</span></p> \\\\n<p>For January I ended up being off by about 500 people, Gaba says. It was ridiculous.</p> \\\\n<p>This is how Gaba was able to predict on his blog that the White House had hit 6 million sign-ups in the last week of March before the White House had even announced the news. One administration official suggested on Twitter, after that he should take a victory lap.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>'I'm getting a little nervous.'</span></h3> \\\\n<p>Gaba doesn't fully understand how he became so entangled in the enrollment numbers &mdash; except that it's become enough of a time commitment to negatively affect his actual web development business.</p> \\\\n<p><span>My website clients are like 'that's great you're mentioned in the New York Times but where's my website,' he says. I'm a little behind on some of my work. </span><span>I've had to give a few good-faith discounts as an apology.</span></p> \\\\n<p>We spoke the last weekend of March, just before open enrollment was slated to end. Gaba had cleared his schedule for March 31 and April 1, expecting a deluge of media requests and tracking data. At that point, he was forecasting 6.7 million sign-ups by the end of March (a number he revised upwards to 6.9-7.0 million mid-day March 31 , as reports of a sign-up surge grew).</p> \\\\n<p>I'm getting a little nervous, Gaba told me. There are so many variables. I know there's going to be a surge but don't know how much of a surge.</p> \\\\n<p>Gaba was initially planning to quit blogging enrollment numbers at the end of March &mdash; until the Obama administration announced it would allow some sign-ups to continue into April. So now he's committed to running his website through the end of this open enrollment period. He's not sure about next year.</p> \\\\n<p><span>It seems to be filling a need right now, so I'll stick with it, he says. By the end of the month, hopefully everyone will move on.

Psychologists Mike Morrison and Neal Roese called up 370 adults and asked them to report one regret of theirs in detail. As the <a href=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/2011/romantic-regrets.aspx>chart</a> shows, personal regrets were reported more than professional ones. While no single category dominated, the education, career, and finance categories amounted to only 35 percent of regrets reported. The rest dealt with things like romance, family, parenting, health, friendships, and spirituality.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-1 class=list-1 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2547882/Screenshot_2014-12-13_15.20.03.0.png></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf> \\\\n              Stone et al \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>This is what you regret from college</h4> \\\\n          <p>This chart, from a report by Charley Stone, Carl Van Horn, and Cliff Zukin from the Heldrich Center at Rutgers, shows <a href=http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Chasing_American_Dream_Report.pdf>the biggest regrets of 444 college grads</a> from the classes of 2006 through 2011, as stated in the spring of 2012. Some of these aren't really regrets, since they're not things that are totally under the control of the person in question (you can't conjure up offers for internships or part-time jobs out of thin air). But if you went to college, you probably had control over your major, and a plurality of respondents expressed regrets about their choice there. What do they think they should have done instead? Well, the survey also found a majority of all recent college graduates said they wish they had taken more computer and technology classes.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-2 class=list-2 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/ target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/1405862/Screen_Shot_2014-09-29_at_1.42.06_PM.0.png></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/ target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/> \\\\n              Hamilton Project \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>But really, you should regret your major</h4> \\\\n          <p>Recent grads' major regrets have some basis. A paper by the Hamilton Project's Brad Hershbein and Melissa Kearney found substantial variation in median lifetime earnings by major. The median chemical engineering major earns $2.11 million over the course of her career, while the median early childhood education major makes $770,000 (which is distressing given what an important job that is). We don't know how much of this differential is caused by the majors themselves. Students who major in chemical engineering and those who major in early childhood education probably differ in a number of other ways that could also help explain the earnings gap. But especially when you're comparing between related fields where students are likely very similar — say, between chemical engineering and biomedical engineering — you can probably ascribe a good portion of the gap to the difference in specialty.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-3 class=list-3 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/what_happens_to_students_who_fail_to_complete_a_college_degree_is_some/ target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2549896/annual.0.jpg></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/what_happens_to_students_who_fail_to_complete_a_college_degree_is_some/ target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/what_happens_to_students_who_fail_to_complete_a_college_degree_is_some/> \\\\n              Hamilton Project \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>You should've gone to school longer</h4> \\\\n          <p>The causal evidence on majors is murky, but the evidence that going to school for longer increases your income isn't. There's a <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/27/the-tuition-is-too-damn-high-part-ii-why-college-is-still-worth-it/>wide array of experimental and quasi-experimental evidence</a> suggesting that additional years of schooling increase your income. Twin studies — which are able to control for genetics and home environment — find that the twin with more education typically earns more. Studies utilizing the draft lottery — and subsequent access to free education among those selected to fight — find the same thing. People who drop out of high school when they turn 16 earn less if their birthday is in September (and so they miss both junior and senior years) than if it's in June or July (which means they only miss senior year). This chart shows how more schooling correlates with higher earnings, but there's a lot of evidence to suggest it causes higher earnings too.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-share-tools> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool twitter data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Twitter href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n          <a class=feature-photos-share-tool facebook data-source=feature-list-item data-social=Facebook href=javascript:void(0);></a> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li id=list-item-4 class=list-4 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n           \\\\n            <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment-ebook/dp/B00GWSXX26/ref=dp_ob_title_ebook target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4718370/siegel_returns.png></a> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment-ebook/dp/B00GWSXX26/ref=dp_ob_title_ebook target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n           \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment-ebook/dp/B00GWSXX26/ref=dp_ob_title_ebook> \\\\n              Jeremy Siegel \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>You should have invested more in stocks</h4> \\\\n          <p>Are you mostly invested in stocks?

If you put the money in bonds, you'd only get $1,778. If you put it in gold, you'd only have $4.52. It's always possible that the past two hundred years are an anomaly, but it's unclear why things would reverse course now.

That's pretty concerning, given how bad not paying off your card balance every month is. A CreditCards.com analysis based on data from the credit report agency Experian, the Federal Reserve, the New York Fed, TransUnion, and the Census, found that the average account that's paid off in full has $1,098 in debt, whereas the average account with a balance left on it has $7,743. This is intuitive and obvious at some level; if you pay your card off monthly, then your debt balance is just going to be a reflection of your spending patterns, whereas leaving a balance lets it gain interest and accumulate.

UEP guidelines mandate cages that have at least 67 square inches per bird, or a bit more than 8 by 8 inches. About 15 percent of hens, UEP told the Times, are raised by farmers who don't participate in its voluntary animal welfare program or otherwise don't meet that standard. These birds have even more smaller spaces. 2 percent of eggs are cage free, but that just means the hens are kept indoors in big barns, where they have a minimum of 120 square inches (a bit less than 11 by 11 inches), per UEP guidelines. Only 1 percent are free range, and even those offer limited access to the outdoors.

As this <a href=http://sr2learn.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/what-is-academic-rumination/>chart</a>, adapted from a paper by UC - Riverside's Sonja Lyubomirsky and Chris Tkach, illustrates, ruminating on negative thoughts and memories can unlock a vicious cycle that is deeply corrosive to happiness. Rumination in the context of a depressed mood may amplify the effects of the negative mood on thinking by selectively priming mood-relevant information and activating networks of negative memories, beliefs, expectations, and schemas, they write. In turn, the resulting negatively biased judgments and interpretations may maintain, or even enhance, depressed mood, nourishing the vicious cycle between depressed mood and thinking.

In Georgia's 12th district, Republican Rick Allen upset Rep. John Barrow, one of the last of the conservative Southern Democrats who dominated the House for decades and are now going extinct before our eyes.

Virginia and Alaska are still getting returns back and Louisiana is going to a runoff. Democrats got no surprise victories in states like Iowa and Colorado, and they lost North Carolina, where they were leading in late polls.

Obama won both of those states, twice. The other five confirmed Republican gains are concentrated in red states. Thom Tillis picked up North Carolina's seat, which Kay Hagan won in 2008. Arkansas Democrat Mark Pryor was walloped due to the state's rightward tilt and a national Republican wave; the same thing happened to fellow Arkansan Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln in 2010. Meanwhile, popular Democrats retired in three states — South Dakota, Montana, and West Virginia — making all three guaranteed GOP gains.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-4 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2432306/Governor_Results-4pmv2.0.gif target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2432306/Governor_Results-4pmv2.0.gif></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2432306/Governor_Results-4pmv2.0.gif target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Republicans had a good night in governor's races …</h4> \\\\n          <p>Democrats were optimistic they could unseat some unpopular Republican governors this cycle, but got just one of their wishes: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett lost to Democrat Tom Wolf. But Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democratic former Gov. Charlie Crist lost to Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott, despite leading in late polls. Republican Govs. Scott Walker, Sam Brownback, and Rick Snyder held on in Wisconsin, Kansas, and Michigan, respectively. And some Democratic incumbents, like Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, had surprise losses too. Charlie Baker beat Martha Coakley to gain the Massachusetts governorship for Republicans. Vermont's Pete Shumlin got less than a majority, meaning the race goes to the state legislature; both chambers are Democrat-controlled, so Shumlin will almost certainly win, but it's still not ideal. Governor's races weren't the silver lining to the Senate results Democrats hoped they'd would be. They were a disaster for Democrats too.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-5 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2435508/StateSenateControl-Post-Election-GIF.0.gif target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2435508/StateSenateControl-Post-Election-GIF.0.gif></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2435508/StateSenateControl-Post-Election-GIF.0.gif target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>… and state legislature elections</h4> \\\\n          <p>State legislature races <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7149547/congress-not-important-why-state-legislature-matters>matter tremendously</a> (ask <a href=http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/11/3/7149549/john-oliver-state-legislature-election-midterm>John Oliver</a> if you don't believe me) but they tend to get much less election coverage. A few states are still coming in as of this writing, but overall it's a very good night for Republicans. Republicans gained the New Mexico, Minnesota, West Virginia, and New Hampshire Houses. The Nevada Senate flipped too. The West Virginia Senate, also formerly in Democratic hands, is tied. While Republicans ran the New York State Senate due to an agreement with moderate Democrats before this election, they now control it outright. After this year's elections, Democrats will control fewer state legislatures than they have <a href=https://twitter.com/NCSLorg/status/530060630905352192>since 1860</a>.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <hr>\\\\n<h3>The issues</h3> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-7 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430432/marijuana_ballot_results.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430432/marijuana_ballot_results.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430432/marijuana_ballot_results.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Pot was legalized in Oregon and Alaska (and kind of in DC)</h4> \\\\n          <p><a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/6953771/weed-legalization-alaska-florida-oregon-washington-dc-vote#Oregon>Oregon</a> and <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/10/20/6953771/weed-legalization-alaska-florida-oregon-washington-dc-vote#Alaska>Alaska</a> passed outright marijuana legalization last night (yellow outlines indicate states that voted on pot during this election). 90 days after the election in Alaska is certified, adults over 21 will be able to possess up to an ounce of pot (which is quite a bit) and six marijuana plants. After that, the state has a year and a half to set up legal sales. Oregon's measure means that on July 1 of next year, adults over 21 can own up to <i>eight</i> ounces and four plants; the state has until 2016 to implement legal sales.

The unemployment rate has fallen dramatically, to about the same level as in 2002, a year when the incumbent Republicans actually gained seats. Then again, it's also the same level as 2006, when the president's party weathered massive losses. Economic factors just don't play the same, key role in midterms that they do in presidential elections. As UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/upshot/the-economy-elects-presidents-presidents-elect-congress.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1>puts it</a>: Instead of rewarding or punishing the incumbent president for his handling of the nation’s economy, in midterm years voters address the president more directly — by penalizing his party members, on average, but also by calibrating that punishment based on how the president is doing his job.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n      <div class=chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video><div data-ad-slot=athena_features></div></div> \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-12 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430748/structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430748/structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430748/structural_penalty_and_approval_rating.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Presidential approval is really important</h4> \\\\n          <p>Presidential approval ratings are a major factor in determining the victor in midterm races. That might seem counteirntuitive, given that the president isn't actually on the ballot, but the chart makes the inverse relationship between presidential approval and losses incurred by his party pretty apparent. Midterms almost never lead to gains for the president's party; that's only happened three times (1934, 1998, and 2002) in the past century, and under extraordinary circumstances in each case (the Great Depression, Bill Clinton's impending impeachment, and 9/11). The losses are worse when the president is personally unpopular. 2014 played into that pattern, as Obama's low approval ratings translated into heavy Democratic losses. Note that not all Senate and House races are in yet, meaning the numbers for this year are incomplete.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <hr>\\\\n<h3>The voters</h3> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-14 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2429580/race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2429580/race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2429580/race_of_voters_by_election_cycle.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>The electorate was whiter than in presidential elections</h4> \\\\n          <p>Midterm electorates are always whiter than presidential ones, and 2014 fit the pattern; 75 percent of voters were white, compared to 72 percent in 2012.

That sounds like a good thing, but it also means they have more wasted votes (that is, votes above the last one needed to win the election). If those wasted votes were distributed in other races, they could theoretically swing some additional seats toward Democrats. A significant factor here is that Democrats tend to cluster geographically in cities. Redistricting tends to lean in favor of keeping geographic regions together, which means heavily Democratic urban districts and less heavily Republican rural distrcts, implicitly advantaging Republicans. To avoid that, you'd need to draw districts that blend together areas with little in common (inner city Pittsburgh with central Pennsylvania, for example). These kinds of districts are, as political scientists Jowei Chen and Jonathan Rodden <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/opinion/sunday/its-the-geography-stupid.html?_r=0>put it</a>, unlikely to emerge by chance from a nonpartisan process, and they're <i>definitely</i> unlikely to emerge from a partisan, Republican-led redistricting process. And there were <a href=http://redistricting.lls.edu/who-partyfed.php>far more nonpartisan or Republican-led redistricting processes</a> than Democrat-run ones. The result is that wasted votes create a significant (~ 6%) advantage for Republicans, as illustrated by the chart above.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-26 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2428462/Screen_Shot_2014-11-04_at_5.46.40_PM.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n            <a href=http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/printable/images/pdf/congdist/pagecgd113_md.pdf> \\\\n              National Atlas of the United States \\\\n            </a> \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Gerrymandering helped both parties, but especially Republicans</h4> \\\\n          <p>Political scientists disagree about the degree to which gerrymandering is responsible for Republicans' House majority. But there's general agreement, as Vox's Andrew Prokop <a href=http://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/how-important-is-gerrymandering-to-republican-control-of-the-house>put it</a>, that there have been some egregious partisan gerrymanders since the 2010 Census. Because Republicans controlled more state governments than Democrats did post-2010, those gerrymanders disproportionately benefited Republicans, but Democratic states got in on the action too. Here's Maryland's map, which divvies up liberal areas (Baltimore, the DC suburbs), then combines them with less liberal portions of the state; that means Democrats have smaller win margins but more seats overall, and only one seat (the one bordering Delaware) is left to be represented by a Republican. Compare that to Pennsylvania, where Republicans did the opposite: packing liberal urban segments into as few districts as possible, and conceding them to the Democrats to maximize Republican chances in the rest of the state.

Governor Anthony Brown was thought to be well ahead, and would have been the third elected black governor in American history (after Virginia's Doug Wilder and Massachusetts' Deval Patrick, who retired this year). A number of Democratic female candidates, like Massachusetts' Martha Coakley and Wisconsin's Mary Burke, were in close races in states with male incumbents. But all four of those candidates lost in the Republican wave. Republican women, by contrast, did quite well, with Oklahoma's Mary Fallin and New Mexico's Susana Martinez winning easily.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n     \\\\n      <li class=list-46 clearfix feature-photos-list-item> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-photo feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <div class=vox-photo-hack> \\\\n             \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430868/women_in_congress.0.png target=_black><img class=lazy zoom data-src=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430868/women_in_congress.0.png></a> \\\\n              <a href=http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2430868/women_in_congress.0.png target=_blank class=icon-link-ext-alt></a> \\\\n             \\\\n          </div> \\\\n          <p class=feature-photos-caption> \\\\n             \\\\n               \\\\n             \\\\n          </p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-story feature-photos-column> \\\\n          <h4>Women in Congress cross the 100 mark</h4> \\\\n          <p>Regardless of your politics, it's worth celebrating the fact that, for the first time ever, more than 100 women are members of the House or Senate.</p> \\\\n        </div> \\\\n      </li> \\\\n     \\\\n     \\\\n   \\\\n  </ol> \\\\n<div class=chorus-snippet m-fishtank no-responsive-video><div data-ad-slot=athena_features></div></div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n \\\\n<div class=feature-photos-related clearfix> \\\\n  <hr> \\\\n  <h3>Learn more</h3> \\\\n  <ul class=feature-photos-related-list> \\\\n     \\\\n    <li class=feature-photos-related-list-item> \\\\n      <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/5/7159145/9-takeaways-from-the-2014-election> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-image style=background-image: url( 'http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/43460606/repost-us-15149561.0.0_standard_755.0.0.0_cinemaesque_1080.0.jpg' );></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-highlight></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-headline>9 takeaways from the 2014 election</div> \\\\n      </a> \\\\n    </li> \\\\n     \\\\n    <li class=feature-photos-related-list-item> \\\\n      <a href=http://www.vox.com/2014/11/4/7158621/wendy-davis-texas-election-results-2014> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-image style=background-image: url( 'http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/43450612/171542779.0.0_cinemaesque_1080.0.jpg' );></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-highlight></div> \\\\n        <div class=feature-photos-related-headline>Wendy Davis lost.

But once we’re underwater, I can see the rows and rows of PVC trees, suspended above the sand in a grid that stretches away into the distant murk.</p> \\\\n<p>This is a coral nursery. Each tree bears a ripening crop of a hundred or more pieces of coral. The smallest fragments are pinkie-sized, twirling on their tethers as other divers kick by; the largest hang like many-limbed chandeliers, turning slowly in the current. When I get closer, I can see the individual polyps, the anemone-like creatures that make up each fragmented colony. Nestled in the crenellated openings in their solid skeletons, they are waving their fleshy tentacles through the water, feeding.</p> \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n<div class=float-right s-sidebar> \\\\n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=3843486 src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3843486/GettyImages-159653970.0.jpg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;%0D%0A%0D%0A&lt;p&gt;&lt;a%20target= new href=http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming> </p> \\\\n \\\\n<a target=new href=http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming>Global warming, explained</a>\\\\n</div> \\\\n \\\\n<p>We are there to tend the trees: Each one needs to be surveyed, scrubbed of algae, and have its biggest corals subdivided into new cuttings. Any coral bleached by high temperatures or damaged by disease needs to be removed to a nearby heap. This is a daunting task considering that the Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF) maintains five coral nurseries with some 40,000 corals growing on trees just like these ones, all along the spattered arc of the Florida Keys.</p> \\\\n<p>Exaggerating her gestures, a woman named Patty shows us — a group of long-time volunteers and visiting divers — how to hang new cuttings in place of the corals we cut down. We exhale long streamers of air back toward the surface, and move slowly as we pass the shared pliers around, cutting and crimping monofilament with the slow-motion care of astronauts maneuvering in zero gravity.</p> \\\\n<p>I pick up a piece of coral, maybe eight inches long and forked at both ends. It’s a deep amber, except for the bright white tips of its branches. It’s hard to tell how heavy an object is underwater, but this one feels light: A small thing to pin the reef’s future on. I tag it with the name and number of its tree, and drop it into a milk crate with the others we’ve harvested.</p> \\\\n<p>Now it’s time to go plant a reef.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>I got here with a question:</strong> What happens to coral reefs as the ocean warms and acidifies over the coming century? Corals might seem removed from human society, but in fact that not-so-simple question leads to an even scarier follow-up: What happens to us?</p> \\\\n<p>Coral reefs are the richest ocean ecosystems we have — they support an estimated 25 percent of marine species. According to <a href=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3720e.pdf>a 2014 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, reefs are responsible for 17 percent of the protein we consume globally; in some coastal or island countries, like Sierra Leone or the Maldives, that number can be as high as 70 percent. Reefs serve as offshore larders, nurseries for important commercial fish (like tuna), and shelter for important ecological species (like sharks). They’re storm breaks for populated shores and bait for tourists whose dollars support entire local economies.</p> \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n<p>We know that reefs are crucial to the oceans as we know them, and to our societies as we’ve made them — and we know they are in serious trouble. According to one 2000 report, <a href=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Coral/>we’ve lost</a> 27 percent of coral worldwide, and stand to lose another 32 percent in the next 30 years.</p> \\\\n<p>What we don’t know is if there’s anything we can do about it. Luckily, that won’t stop people from trying: Around the world, a scrappy handful of scientists, entrepreneurs, and volunteers are taking on this colossal problem, one branch at a time.</p> \\\\n<p>From regrowing the reefs we’ve already lost to engineering new corals that may be able to survive hotter, more acidic seas, these innovators are fighting everything from nutrient pollution to overfishing to ocean warming itself. If we want to succeed, we might have to learn how to rebuild an entire ecosystem from the bottom up.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p> \\\\n<h3>Restoration</h3> \\\\n<p>What is a coral, really? It’s an animal, but it is also plantlike, an alien amalgam of many clades. It is made up of minuscule individuals and yet its colonies comprise the largest living structures in the natural world.</p> \\\\n<p>Zooming in reveals the tiny components and processes that make up the organism: the fleshy coral polyp within its calcium carbonate skeleton; the microscopic algae that live in symbiosis inside the cells of the animal; the complex microbial communities that live in and around all of them. You’d also observe the way ocean chemistry interacts intimately with the creatures, changing their ability to grow, or the way a half-degree difference in temperature can upset their delicately balanced cellular machinery.</p> \\\\n<p>Zooming out to the reefs themselves reveals geological structures reaching up from the seafloor, growing from millions of tiny mouths and built on the compiled skeletons of previous generations. These house fish and sea urchins that graze on the algae that might otherwise overgrow the corals, larger fish that eat <em>them</em>, and species like sharks, whose existence marks a well-balanced ecosystem and whose absence indicates disorder. Other organisms prey on the coral itself: The crown-of-thorns starfish is so fecund and insatiable that a single individual can populate whole square miles of reef, stripping the coral of its polyps and leaving dead, white skeletons behind.</p> \\\\n<p>Humans have a way of messing with coral at both ends of the scale, from altering the very chemistry of the water they grow in, to destroying thousands of miles of reef by dredging, polluting, overfishing, and just generally overloading them.</p> \\\\n<p>But some people think that in order to fix coral, we’ll have to keep meddling. We’ll just have to do it better.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288083>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288083/grist-coral-2.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>The Coral Restoration Foundation’s nursery is made up of PVC-pipe trees where corals grow quickly in the nutrient-rich current.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p><strong>Ken Nedimyer, founder of the Coral Restoration Foundation, leans hard on the coral-as-trees metaphor.</strong> If you can regrow a forest from a nursery, he thought, why not a reef? Aside from a few frustrating particulars and unknowns about coral husbandry, the model made sense to him. But no one had tried it.</p> \\\\n<p>In 40 years of diving in the Florida Keys, Nedimyer has watched the place change into something unrecognizable: The reefs I saw in the early ‘70s were just fabulous. I remember going to Carysfort, and it was just acres and acres of elkhorn coral, coming right to the surface. You couldn’t swim over it; you couldn’t see the end of it. Most of the reefs in the Florida Keys were like that.</p> \\\\n<p>As the stepping-stone islands filled up with people, the surrounding seas filled up with their boats and sewage. Until very recently, wastewater from the Florida Keys was flushed right out to sea or pumped into leaky septic systems. As a result, all those spectacular near-shore reefs that had made the place famous suffered a 30-year-long string of disease outbreaks, algal blooms, dredging, damage from boats, and overfishing. Today, the Carysfort Reef has mostly turned to skeletal rubble, overgrown with algae and largely empty of fish.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>The problem with coral in the Keys is not unique in the Caribbean.</strong> A <a href=http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf>comprehensive study</a> of the Caribbean’s reefs from 1972 to 2012 found that coral declined by more than 80 percent, with most of that loss concentrated in the ’80s and ’90s. An outbreak of White Band Disease knocked out almost all of the region’s staghorn and elkhorn corals — the branching corals that make up the bulk of the region’s reef structure. Another disease wiped out the local sea urchins that kept algae in check. Then in 1997 and 1998, the <a href=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/techrpts/tr9802/tr9802.pdf>strongest-ever El Niño</a> observed to date hit, and ocean temperatures shot up. Caribbean corals, struggling in the hot water, expelled their symbiotic algae and slowly starved to death, in some of the worst bleaching events in the history.</p> \\\\n<p>In the late ’90s, a series of papers proclaimed the end of reefs, eventual or imminent. Even if we could stop dumping so much (literal) shit and sludge on the reefs, we almost certainly couldn’t stop the global warming that had already started raising ocean temperatures above the threshold at which coral survival seemed impossible. Surely these fragile creatures, the foundation for so many critical ecosystems, would not be able to exist in that hot future world. Surely, they were all doomed.</p> \\\\n<p>But what seemed like a foregone conclusion to pessimistic scientists seemed like a call to arms for others. Nedimyer was of the latter. An aquarium collector, he spent most of his time underwater, catching tropical fish to sell to public and private aquariums. When an elkhorn coral started to grow on some aquarium live rock he was tending, Nedimyer had an idea. While elkhorn is a federally protected species in the Caribbean, the law was that anything growing on Ken’s live rock — including elkhorn — belonged to him. He could do what he wanted with it.</p> \\\\n<p>Nedimyer knew he could probably make a tidy fortune by growing the rare coral to sell cuttings to aquariums. But he wanted to do something bigger. So Nedimyer and his 13-year-old daughter started with a 4H project, fragmenting the original coral to grow each piece into a new colony. They were practicing for the nursery Nedimyer had pictured, an enormous underwater forest capable of restoring the Caribbean’s reefs to their former state, the way he had known them 40 years before.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288089>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288089/grist-coral-3.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>A thicket of transplanted staghorn coral takes root in the Florida Keys.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p><strong>In 2003, Nedimyer got federal permission to plant six corals</strong> in a spot on Molasses Reef in the Florida Keys. In 2007, after a string of bad luck and hurricanes that kept them off the reef, they planted 18. In 2015, Nedimyer and the small staff of the Coral Restoration Foundation, along with a legion of volunteers, have planted more than 18,000 of them.</p> \\\\n<p>Jessica Levy manages the CRF’s restoration program, which means she is out on the water most days — gathering corals from the nurseries, monitoring for signs of trouble, and planting new batches of coral on the reef. The corals she works with are the offspring of wild patches of elkhorn and staghorn that survived the mass die-offs of the last few decades.</p> \\\\n<p>If they’ve gone through bleaching events and survived, if they’ve gone through cold events and survived, they’re a stronger coral, Levy says. They’re the ones that you want to fragment and grow and plant back on the reef. The idea being, if they survived it then, they’ll survive it now.</p> \\\\n<p>In the nursery, coral grow two or three times faster than they grow on the reef. Suspended in the water column, they can gather nutrients from the current and grow in all directions without expending energy to affix themselves to the reef. Once planted, they spend a few months stabilizing, forming new tissue over the epoxy used to cement them in place. Then they start growing again.</p> \\\\n<p>Since they’re planted in groups of the same genotype, the corals grow together as they get bigger, forming tangled thickets that provide the kind of shelter and support a reef so badly needs. Levy says that, so far, about 80 percent of the transplants are still alive after two years on the reef. Impressive results, especially considering no one has ever tried a project like this at scale before.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288093>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288093/grist-coral-5.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>A volunteer coordinator for CRF readies a boatload of divers.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p>Nevertheless, Nedimyer and Levy and the rest of CRF know they are facing a Herculean task if they expect to replant all of Florida’s reefs by hand. But, luckily, they don’t. Even the reefs where they’ve been planting corals since the beginning are still mostly bare, featuring the odd thicket of staghorn or stubborn boulder coral.</p> \\\\n<p>Levy says CRF’s real goal is not to repopulate the reefs coral by coral, but to preserve the genetic diversity the species needs to stay resilient. By gathering corals from the reef, CRF can save genotypes that might otherwise be lost from the wild. Eventually, if CRF can just boost population density a little, the corals can start reproducing on their own again.</p> \\\\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles is that as these populations stand now, when they do go to spawn, they’re so far apart, Levy points out. Corals are hermaphroditic, producing bundles of both sperm and eggs during a yearly spawning event, but elkhorn and staghorn can’t fertilize themselves. They trust that their spawn will mingle in the water column, meet other coral spawn, fertilize, and avoid being eaten long enough to settle out and start growing new coral. But right now, says Levy, these guys are so fragmented that there’s no chance of meeting up.</p> \\\\n<p>It’s a big ocean. The goal was never to outplant every coral on every reef. That’s not sustainable, Levy says, on a rare day in her office on land. That’s the part that can be hard to explain to people, who can’t see the point of scattering a few thousand corals across reefs that once hosted millions. The goal is to get genetic diversity out there, to the point where they’re naturally reproducing. Basically, to boost natural recovery.</p> \\\\n<p>If that sounds like a big gamble to you — it is. But it might be our best bet.</p> \\\\n<div> \\\\n<div style=left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;><iframe style=top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; mozallowfullscreen=true webkitallowfullscreen=true allowfullscreen=true frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mEBPQPvo4c?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1></iframe></div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p></p> \\\\n<p><strong>To plant a coral, you first have to clear a place for it.</strong> You do this (I am a little alarmed to learn) with the chisel end of a hammer.</p> \\\\n<p>The day after we gathered our coral cuttings from the nursery, we go out on Molasses Reef, one of the most visited reefs in the Keys. I take a hammer from Patty and tentatively begin tapping the reef substrate, a compressed residue of coral rubble and sand, riddled with strange, iridescent sea worms.</p> \\\\n<p>This is not easy. Picture an astronaut trying to hammer a nail in space: For every fraction of an inch the nail goes in, the astronaut floats back a foot. In my case, each careful chisel blow to the rock sends me drifting upward like an untethered balloon. To stay down, I have to direct my head and all my attention downward while kicking steadily, as I scrape the rock clear of its algal fuzz.</p> \\\\n<p>I brace my coral firmly against a spot on the cleared substrate with one hand, while with the other I pinch off small globs of purple epoxy. Each branch gets a dab, and the whole thing goes down onto the spot I’ve cleared.</p> \\\\n<p>At least in theory: Between my own drift and wafting clouds of sediment from the divers chiseling on either side of me, it takes some maneuvering before I can get my branch of staghorn anchored firmly to the rock. To test its structural integrity, I wave my hand over it like I’m trying to fan out a flame. Sediment flies up in a cloud, but my coral — it stays put. Success.</p> \\\\n<p>It takes about 40 minutes for four of us to plant all 10 corals in one thicket, an area easily encompassed by a hula-hoop. As all the groups start to ascend, I can’t help but think that it doesn’t look like much. Together, we have managed to plant a single milk-crate’s worth of corals over a badminton court-sized patch of seafloor. This on the bare, rocky remains of a reef that stretches to the limits of visibility.</p> \\\\n<p>But something happens as we continue to rise. Fish dart in to fill the space we have made, rushing to gulp the worms we’ve dislodged in all that scraping and hammering. Suddenly, our sad jumble of coral looks a lot more like a habitat.</p> \\\\n<p>From 20 feet above the sea floor, I can see thickets of staghorn planted in the previous year or so. I can see how the disparate pieces of coral have grown up and together, knitting their branches into a kind of a dome. I can see, finally, where they have grown over the epoxy lumps that first sealed them to the reef. They have already taken root.</p> \\\\n<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p> \\\\n<h3>Selection</h3> \\\\n<p>On a tiny island called Ofu, part of American Samoa just south of the equator and east of the International Date Line, corals are doing something that might have once seemed impossible.</p> \\\\n<p>Under the intense heat of the southern sun, in a shallow lagoon where water temperatures can reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit, coral reefs are thriving. While corals elsewhere struggle when water temperatures reach the mid ’80s, these equatorial corals can handle the extra degrees without breaking a sweat. Those are the kinds of water temperatures people expect to see by the end of this century, which means, in a sense, Ofu’s corals are already living in the future.</p> \\\\n<p>Marine biologist Steve Palumbi wants to find out how these corals are so chill about extreme heat. A researcher at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, Palumbi wanted to know if these outlying supercorals could hold the key to a secret resiliency available to all corals.</p> \\\\n<p>Corals live in a very variable environment and they have for millions of years, Palumbi tells me one afternoon, in his office in Monterey, Calif. So it stands to reason that perhaps, in corals that live right now, there are already some that have adapted to live in future environments.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288129>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288129/coral-grist.6.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>Thickets of coral growing in the super-heated water off of Ofu, in American Samoa.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p>So Palumbi took a team of researchers and students to Ofu to put the supercorals through their paces. He chose to focus on a type of <em>Acropora</em> — the same genus that includes elkhorn and staghorn corals — called tabletop corals. As their name suggests, they grow in broad, table-like ledges, gathering as much solar energy as they can and providing shelter and shade for other species.</p> \\\\n<p>Fast-growing and generally susceptible to heat extremes, <em>Acropora</em> are both a fundamental builder of reef architecture and usually one of the more fragile species on the reef. If Ofu’s tabletops seemed hardier than usual, Palumbi was determined to find out why.</p> \\\\n<p>Using portable water coolers (the kind you’d use to stash a couple six-packs at a picnic) rigged with heating and refrigerating elements, the researchers took fragments of coral from the reef and subjected them to a uniform battery of stress tests. As the temperatures inched up, and the corals became more and more stressed, they started to expel the photosynthetic algae they need to live, and eventually bleached.</p> \\\\n<p>Here’s what’s interesting: The corals the researchers chose for testing came from different parts of the same reef, some of which experienced much higher temperatures on a regular basis. These warm-adjusted corals were much less likely to bleach under high temperatures than those that came from cooler parts of the reef.</p> \\\\n<div> \\\\n<div style=left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;><iframe style=top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; mozallowfullscreen=true webkitallowfullscreen=true allowfullscreen=true frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/--XHZZKu-ac?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1></iframe></div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p></p> \\\\n<p><strong>There are two mechanisms by which these corals (or any organism really) can adjust to an extreme environment</strong> — increased temperature, for example. The first, acclimation, is a short-term process whereby individual organisms change their physiology to become more heat tolerant. Then there’s adaptation, the longer-term process of natural selection whereby certain individuals pass on the genetic traits that make them more successful in warmer environments.</p> \\\\n<p>In other words: Acclimation is the tan you get on vacation, while adaptation is the skin tone you’re born with. In both cases, having more pigment in your skin reduces your risk of getting sunburned. So an organism’s life history might approximate some of the advantages of a genetic predisposition, through different mechanisms.</p> \\\\n<p>With corals, the combination of the two factors is more powerful than either on its own. To test this, Palumbi’s team transplanted corals from the cooler part of the reef to the warmest pool. They left them there for three years, after which the researchers subjected them to the same set of stress tests they’d undergone three years earlier, raising the temperature to an extreme level for several days at a time.</p> \\\\n<p>This time, the cool-adapted corals that had spent the last three years acclimating in warm pools did noticeably better than their cold-water clones. But the original warm-pool corals still outperformed their acclimated cousins, suggesting some older genetic advantage was also at work.</p> \\\\n<p>The next step, Palumbi says, is to start trying to use these supercorals to help corals in general. To that end, his PhD student, Megan Morikawa, is establishing a coral nursery off the coast of Ofu, where she hopes to cultivate the most resilient, heat-tolerant corals they find. Like Nedimyer, they want to replenish reefs with corals, and with the genetic diversity that will allow them to survive in a range of environments.</p> \\\\n<p>It’s too early to know if this will work. Palumbi is hopeful that something can be done, but aware of the challenges in scaling this kind of experiment up to a level where it can actually be effective.</p> \\\\n<p>You can’t go to a replanted reef, he says in his office, thousands of miles away from Ofu. You can go to a replanted forest, but as of now, there is no replanted reef.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288135><img src=https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288135/coral-grist.7.jpg></div> \\\\n<p><strong>When a coral bleaches, it doesn’t necessarily die</strong> — which means some interesting things can happen after a bleaching event sweeps a reef.</p> \\\\n<p>A coral polyp gathers some of its food from the water current, but it gets most of its energy by harvesting the sun’s energy, using tiny algae called zooxanthellae that live inside its cells. As the water heats up, those little algae start to produce chemicals that irritate the coral cells. As these so-called free radicals build up, they start to damage the cell until the coral polyp gets so agitated it expels most or all of its zooxanthellae.</p> \\\\n<p>From then, the coral polyp is essentially on its own. It loses the pigment it gets from its symbiont algae, turning pale white, and loses the energy it gets from photosynthesis. Without that energy, the coral feeds on its reserves and strains what food it can get from the water column. It stops growing and is at risk of eventually starving to death.</p> \\\\n<p>If the temperature drops again, the polyp can take up new zooxanthellae from the water and keep growing as before. But the longer the coral stays bleached, the less likely it will be able to recover.</p> \\\\n<p>However, there is a secondary effect to all this bleaching and unbleaching, which Palumbi and others have seized on as a possible source of hope. After a coral has bleached once, the next time it is subjected to abnormally high temperatures, it is much less likely to succumb.</p> \\\\n<p>In the same El Niño season that wiped out Florida’s corals, the reefs around the tiny island nation of Palau bleached <a href=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380100151>extensively</a>. Today, nearly 10 years later, they have almost completely recovered, Palumbi says. In fact, at this point most reefs in the world have bleached, he says. And a good number of them have recovered.</p> \\\\n<p>So corals are resilient, maybe more than we thought, and can recover from near-fatal events. But how fast can they keep up? In all their history — and at <a href=http://www.coris.noaa.gov/about/what_are/>400 million years</a>, it’s a long one — the organisms have never experienced a rate of change like what they are subjected to today.</p> \\\\n<p>What’s more, a coral’s vulnerability to and recovery from bleaching have a lot to do with the presence of other stressors, Palumbi points out. With pollution, habitat destruction, overfishing, sedimentation, and so on, what would be a tolerable amount of climate change can become an intolerable amount.</p> \\\\n<p>In this sense, Ofu is a lucky place to be a coral. Sure, the corals living in the sheltered lagoons of the remote island may have to put up with 95 degrees F — but they don’t have to deal with many humans.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>Corals can adapt and acclimate to higher temperatures — but only to a point.</strong> Even Palumbi’s supercorals, subjected to monstrously high temperatures in the stress tanks, have a limit. Eventually, given enough global warming, the world’s reefs will find their limits, too.</p> \\\\n<p>I can’t do everything, Palumbi admits. But if I can just help keep the ocean alive long enough for us to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels, we can make it.</p> \\\\n<p>This summer, Palumbi brought 80 corals back from Ofu, small fragments from the different genotypes and environments he was hoping to test in the lab. Then all but two of the corals died when he got them to the lab, and they took their heat-resisting secrets with them. Palumbi will have to go back to the reef and start over. But he’s determined to find the corals of the world that possess the superpower to resist higher ocean temperatures, and protect them.</p> \\\\n<p>Saving the ocean for the next 85 years — that’s a pretty good job, he says. I just need to show people that it is worth it.</p> \\\\n<p><strong>Part 3</strong></p> \\\\n<h3>Evolution</h3> \\\\n<p>The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences stands alone at the tip of Queensland’s Cape Cleveland and looks out over the Coral Sea, toward the Great Barrier Reef.</p> \\\\n<p>Inside sits an array of temperature- and pH-controlled tanks, sediment pumps, and stacks of high-octane computers. With all that tech, AIMS, a federally funded research center, can feel a little like NASA, if NASA were dropped in the middle of Australia and had its laser-assisted focus retrained on the oceans. High-security access badges: Check. Brilliant, high-powered scientists: Check. Evocative acronyms: So many checks.</p> \\\\n<p>The blocky brick building I come to at the end of 50 km of wallaby-strewn highway is an unassuming advertisement for the pie-in-the-sky projects unfolding inside. And so, with not a little cognitive dissonance, I sign my name on a standard-issue clipboard, and head to the world’s first Sea Simulator — the SeaSim, for short.</p> \\\\n<p>The 10,000-square-foot facility was built with the help of a $27 million <a href=http://www.scienceinpublic.com.au/media-releases/37-million-sea-simulator>grant</a> from the Australian government (that’s $37 million in AUD) and the ambition to do the kinds of long-running, multi-variable experiments never before possible in run-of-the-mill marine biology labs.</p> \\\\n<p>The sprawling building contains an upper story with a double row of sealed rooms, each controlled by a monitor panel outside. In some, heavy-duty pumps suspend dredge sediment in tanks lit a deep dance-club blue; others hold aquariums full of crown-of-thorns starfish, nightmarish, spiny creatures whose unchecked appetites have decimated whole swaths of reef.</p> \\\\n<p>But downstairs, I find what I came for: an enormous, open-plan room that will hold the nine tanks of Madeleine van Oppen’s time machine.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>In February of this year,</strong> Madeleine van Oppen and her colleague Ruth Gates of the University of Hawaii published a paper suggesting that we start researching whether it’s possible for humans to help corals evolve to survive in a climate-changed world.</p> \\\\n<p>They called it assisted evolution, and it was a new approach to the same old problem: Corals already possess some innate resilience, but they cannot evolve fast enough to keep up with the accelerating pace of climate change. So let’s just make them evolve faster.</p> \\\\n<p>With a grant from the Paul-Allen-funded <a href=http://www.pgafamilyfoundation.org/oceanchallenge/>Ocean Challenge</a> prize, covering a five-year-long research project split between AIMS and the University of Hawaii, van Oppen and company set out to see if that’s even possible. If they could breed new generations of corals that outperformed their parents, maybe they could identify the secret to coral resilience, be it genetic, microbial, or something else altogether.</p> \\\\n<p>And for that, they need corals. A lot of them.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288139>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288139/coral-grist.9.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>AIMS staff unload samples of coral and sand from the Great Barrier Reef, to be used in SeaSim experiments.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p>The boat comes in in the afternoon. Van Oppen drives me down to the port, where researchers with a heavy crane are lifting pallets of stacked plastic bins from the deck of the dive boat into the back of a truck. It’s sunny, so they work fast — these corals have come from Davies Reef, a nearby patch of the Great Barrier, and they are likely feeling the heat.</p> \\\\n<p>As he sloshes excess seawater out of the bins, research manager Neal Cantin explains to me what they’ve brought back: entire tubs of sand and sediment, heaps of worn-down and overgrown old coral skeletons (or live rock), some algae and sponges for a different experiment, and, of course, about 80 coral colonies for van Oppen’s experiment.</p> \\\\n<p>The corals are the main event, but the sand and sundry are important, too. With all these ingredients — and the ambient microbial communities they host — the researchers can create a rough copy of the reef the corals just left. Then, using data from a weather tower right over Davies Reef, they can adjust the water temperature throughout the day to match natural conditions as closely as possible.</p> \\\\n<p>I hitch a ride back to the SeaSim with a couple of tubs of coral and live rock. There, in the largest chamber of the Sea Simulator, Cantin and a graduate student are arranging the corals in three long tanks, flushed with seawater and lit with full-spectrum LEDs that mimic sunshine. These tanks will serve as an indoor ocean to these corals for the next five years, or longer.</p> \\\\n<p>Eventually, there will be nine tanks in the enormous, hangar-like room, grouped by threes: One trio will be treated with water heated and cooled to match the real-time temperature data from Davies Reef. The pH levels will match normal variations the reef might experience over the course of an average day, becoming more acidic at night, in the absence of photosynthesis. The second set will have its water heated and soured to match the ocean conditions we are predicted to experience by midcentury. The third will experience the most extreme conditions, with temperatures and acidity mimicking what we might see by 2100 if climate change is left unchecked.</p> \\\\n<p>All the corals will spend a few months acclimating to these new normals. The scientists expect many of them will become stressed, even bleach — but that’s only the beginning. What they really want to find out is how the kids do.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>The idea that humans might assist evolution, while it sounds wacky, is not truly anything that new.</strong> We’ve been changing the evolution of plenty of species, intentionally and otherwise, for about as long as we’ve been living in social groups. We assist evolution when we breed animals to perpetuate traits — milk production, for example, or docile behavior — that we find beneficial. We also can be said to assist evolution when we build environments, like cities, where certain animals, like pigeons, can find an ecological niche that never existed in the wild.</p> \\\\n<p>And we’re <em>already</em> applying selective pressures to coral. From global warming to ocean acidification, we’re changing the natural environment such that some corals are better adapted to survive than others. But evolution, while it’s happening, is not happening fast enough — and those selective pressures of ocean acidification and ocean warming run the risk of selecting reefs right out of existence.</p> \\\\n<p>Genetic selection is the most familiar kind of evolution, but the process of accumulating genetic adaptations is typically a slow one, reliant on chance mutations that occur in the right place at the right time. And corals only spawn once a year and grow slowly — which means there aren’t many chances to get things right.</p> \\\\n<p>So van Oppen’s group is looking to find the helpful mutations first, and maybe eventually find a way to spread them among wild corals. She is also looking for epigenetic changes in the corals, which is a catch-all term for the things that act on the genome, but are not a part of it.</p> \\\\n<p>For example, certain molecules may be attached to parts of an organism’s DNA, controlling whether a certain gene is turned on or off. If the gene is turned off, the cell won’t produce the protein that the gene codes for. In this way, an individual of a species may possess all the genes necessary to produce some trait without actually <em>expressing</em> the trait — all depending on its epigenetics.</p> \\\\n<p>These epigenetic markers have, in some cases, seemed to be heritable from a parent organism to its offspring. Van Oppen believes that epigenetics may hold the key to jump-starting corals’ non-traditional evolution in the face of warmer, more acidic waters. And if we can get a head-start on climate change by seeing what these changes might look like, maybe we can help nudge today’s reefs in the direction they need to go.</p> \\\\n<div data-chorus-asset-id=4288141>\\\\n<img src=https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4288141/coral-grist.10.jpg> \\\\n<div class=caption>Baby <em>Pocillopora</em> growing up in the SeaSim tanks.</div> \\\\n</div> \\\\n<p><strong><em>Pocillopora</em></strong><strong> — poss-ill-uh-pour-uh — </strong><strong><em>acuta</em></strong><strong> are pale, knobby lumps of coral</strong>, each about the size and shape of a head of cauliflower. They are fast-growing and branching, which makes them important reef building species, not unlike the more common <em>Acropora</em>.</p> \\\\n<p>But <em>Pocillopora</em> do one weird thing differently from most other corals. Instead of spawning just once a year, <em>Pocillopora</em> can reproduce asexually, releasing fully formed clonal larvae every month or so. In van Oppen’s lab, these larvae will settle onto little ceramic discs prepared by researchers and start to grow. Some of the baby corals will be moved around — the hot future larvae back to cold present-day tanks, and vice versa — to see how they do. Then this whole step will be repeated one more time, with a third generation of corals.</p> \\\\n<p>If the second- and third-generations of corals born and raised in future ocean conditions seem robust, that may tell us about how reefs could change in real-time. But even if corals are capable of keeping up with stressfully high temperatures and acidity, they still may change in ways that will fundamentally change the reefs themselves. The corals may not grow as fast, and they may reproduce differently. Larvae might have more trouble developing, or might develop differently.</p> \\\\n<p>And if the third generation of <em>Pocillopora</em> do end up stronger than their forebearers? The next step could be one of sci-fi proportions: to take these speed-evolved corals out onto the reef. These ultra resilient corals could potentially be used to restore damaged reefs, while providing a set of genes that could pass some of that accelerated resilience on to the next generation.</p> \\\\n<p>The other experiments van Oppen’s team will be running have some similarly stunning implications. For example, if the scientists experimentally evolve a strain of symbiotic zooxanthellae that makes its coral host more resistant to bleaching, they could conceivably grow huge tanks of it, to dump on reefs during especially hot spells.</p> \\\\n<p>To be clear, these are all pretty long shots for a lot of different reasons. But even if they’re shown to work, is it a good idea?</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p><strong>It’s not up to us in the end</strong> whether it will actually be implemented, Madeleine van Oppen told me, before I could even ask. Her experiments are such an early step on the road to large-scale reef engineering that she only spends a few minutes talking about the possibility. For van Oppen, the important thing is that we at least start asking the right questions. Answering them is a whole different research project.</p> \\\\n<p>What we definitely don’t want to do, she says, is to introduce new problems into a system we’ve already thrown out of whack. We are very good at messing things up, changing this planet tremendously, van Oppen says. We’re also very innovative and intelligent, I suppose. We’ve come up with lots of good solutions.</p> \\\\n \\\\n<div class=float-right s-sidebar> \\\\n<p><img data-chorus-asset-id=4289589 src=https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4289589/climate-change.png&gt;&lt;/p&gt;%0D%0A%0D%0A&lt;p&gt;&lt;a%20target= new href=http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9567863/climate-change-ambitious-cuts> </p> \\\\n \\\\n<a target=new href=http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9567863/climate-change-ambitious-cuts>The math on staying below 2°C of global warming looks increasingly brutal</a>\\\\n</div> \\\\n \\\\n<p>One thing is sure: We’ll have to put the brakes on climate change eventually, if we want to stave off disaster — on this point, everyone agrees. But even if we phase out greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 or 20 years, the atmosphere and oceans will continue to warm for years after — so we need to be prepared to deal with that.</p> \\\\n<p>In a certain light, this crisis is nothing new for humans, says van Oppen: We pollute the environment and then we clean it up. We develop bacteria that can digest hydrocarbons when there’s been an oil spill. It’s no different from other things where we clean up after the mess we have made. We do that all the time. Unfortunately, that’s how humans are.</p> \\\\n<p>I’m starting to get the sense that if scientists, governments, and nonprofits can figure out how to engineer a better coral reef, it will be because, in the end, it’s easier to change nature itself than it is to change human nature.</p> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<hr> \\\\n<p> </p> \\\\n<p>The Great Barrier Reef is a bucket list item if there ever was one. It’s the largest living barrier reef in the world, roughly <a href=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/about-the-reef/facts-about-the-great-barrier-reef>the size of Italy</a>, and one of the only biological objects visible from space.</p> \\\\n<p>Home to some of the strangest (and most venomous) creatures in the ocean, the GBR is a poster child of what we stand to lose as the oceans warm. I had always wanted to see it for myself.</p> \\\\n<p>So one morning, on an ocean as flat and blue as a swimming pool, empty of other boats all the way to the cloud-strewn horizon, I hold a mask and regulator to my face and step into the water.</p> \\\\n<p>Underneath, huge mounds of coral rise 30 feet from the seafloor almost to the surface. I am surprised to find that these seamounts — called bommies in Aussie — are veritable catalogue advertisements of reef health and diversity. I see all kinds of <em>Acropora</em> — big, branching thickets of elkhorn, wide terraces of tabletop coral — all colored a healthy deep orange or yellow. <em>Pocillopora</em> sit on the tops of lower mounts like frilly heads of lettuce. I see enormous brain corals and tiny, fine-fingered soft corals that swayed in the current.</p> \\\\n<p>All around these pillars and buttresses, life swarms and flashes like static electricity: angelfish, damselfish, clownfish, a massive school of yellow-finned jacks winding between two bommies. There are skates bearing blue spots the size of silver dollars and parrotfish in all the colors of an ’80s aerobics instructor’s leotard. Electric-blue seastars stand out like asterisks on the sand, where giant clams flick their purple lips as I swim over.</p> \\\\n<p>If there is trouble on the Great Barrier Reef — and, by all accounts, there is — I can’t see a sign of it from behind my mask. In all its wild wholeness, this little patch of Edenic reef seems to stand both for what has been lost everywhere else, and what we stand to save.</p> \\\\n<p>But as I haul myself back out of the water — suddenly transformed back into a clumsy two-legged creature wearing 60 pounds of dive equipment and a fogged mask in front of my face — I feel both smaller and bigger than before. No matter how much I wanted to believe it while I was underwater, I knew that the idea of a pristine reef is an illusion. There are no virgin reefs to preserve. Any reef, any ecosystem, no matter how lovely, is in the process of being affected by the 7 billion (and counting) people of the world.</p> \\\\n<p>But that’s the way it’s always been. The reef is always changing: It is fed by currents and smashed by storms, and subject to the whims of the animals moving in waves over it. Flux is a fact of nature, and humans are now a part of that. If we want to start setting right some of the balances we’ve upset, coral reefs are as good a symbol as any of where our real work begins — at the intersection between the world and ourselves.</p> \\\\n<p><em>This story was supported by a grant from the </em><em><a href=http://earthjournalism.net/>Earth Journalism Network</a></em><em>.</em></p> \\\\n<p><em>Grist is a nonprofit news site that uses humor to shine a light on big green issues.

       "           \\\\nA state representative from Alabama wrote a Facebook post this weekend in which she threatened to expose the affairs of politicians trying to restore the state's ban on same-sex marriage, Kent Faulk of AL.com reports. \\\\nState Rep. Patricia Todd (D) — the first openly gay legislator elected in Alabama — had praised a federal judge's January 23 ruling striking down the ban. But when the House Speaker and Attorney General argued that a higher court should stay the order, Todd posted this on Facebook: \\\\n \\\\n\"This (is) a time where you find out who are accepting, loving people. To say I am disappointed in Speaker Hubbard comment's and Attorney General Strange choice to appeal the decision is an understatement. I will not stand by and allow legislators to talk about 'family values' when they have affairs, and I know of many who are and have. I will call our elected officials who want to hide in the closet OUT\" \\\\n \\\\nLater, Todd stood by her unusual threat, arguing that the circumstances called for it, as you can see in the video up top. \"Think about all the people in this room, and all the love that you feel for each other and these couples who are about to make history of being the first couples married in the state of Alabama,\" she said. \"We have families that will now be legitimized overnight. Children who will be affected and be able to call both parents 'mom' or 'dad.'\" \\\\n\"This is the fight of our life. This is why I ran for office.\" \\\\nTodd continued: \"That's a true family value. Many of you all know that I have thrown the gauntlet down to my elected peers that should they decide to go and spout that family value, then I'm gonna call 'em out. And I'm willing to jeopardize my political campaign to do it. This is the fight of our life. This is why I ran for office. I'm not a politician, I'm an activist.\" \\\\nA district court judge has issued a short-term stay on the Alabama ruling, pending appellate court action — so same-sex couples can't currently marry in the state. If the appellate court takes no action by February 9, the lower court ruling striking down the same-sex marriage ban will go into effect.

       "           \\\\nFBI Director James Comey gave a speech Thursday acknowledging the \"hard truths\" about racial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system. \\\\nComey spoke frankly about improving the police's relationship with young black men: \\\\n \\\\nThose of us in law enforcement must redouble our efforts to resist bias and prejudice. We must better understand the people we serve and protect. By trying to know, deep in our gut, what it feels like to be a law-abiding, young black man walking down the street and encountering law enforcement. We must understand how that young man may see us. We must resist the lazy shortcomings of cynicism. \\\\n \\\\nComey's speech attempted to invoke a middle ground in recent debates about racial disparities. He argued that police officers \"are overwhelmingly doing the right thing for the right reasons.\" But he also said he's not trying to \"let law enforcement off the hook.\" \\\\nComey said police must develop processes to overcome their subconscious biases against minority groups. Research shows this bias is real: studies prove that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado at Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research, previously said it's possible the bias could lead to more skewed outcomes in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" he said, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\" \\\\nComey also argued that the FBI and police must improve the ways they collect data on arrests and shootings, echoing a call made by US Attorney General Eric Holder. Currently, the federal government doesn't collect comprehensive data on people killed by police or officers killed in attacks. The FBI gathers some data, but the figures are generally viewed as the minimum numbers, since reporting by police departments is voluntary. \\\\nRacial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system have received a lot of attention in the past year, particularly after the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. The shooting of Brown set off a  nationwide movement to raise awareness about the death of young black men, under the banner, \"Black Lives Matter.\" \\\\nComey's full speech is available at the FBI's website. \\\\nVideo taken from Time magazine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              :    1  \n",
       "           \\\\nThe city of Cleveland argued in court that Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy, caused his own death when a police officer shot and killed him after mistaking Rice's pellet gun for an actual firearm. But following criticisms over the accusation, city officials apologized and vowed to change the language in a future court document. \\\\n\"This is not the character or personality of the city of Cleveland … to be that insensitive to family or even to victims,\" Cleveland Mayor Frank  Jackson said at a news conference on Monday, Cleveland.com reported. \\\\nThe city originally presented the argument in a court document responding to a lawsuit from the Rice family. The response stated that Rice's death was caused \"by the failure … to exercise due care to avoid injury,\" according to Cleveland.com. It also said that all of the injuries claimed by his family \"were directly and proximately caused by their own acts,\" not Timothy Loehmann, the officer who fatally shot Rice. \\\\nThe city claimed Rice's death was caused \"by the failure ... to exercise due care to avoid injury\" \\\\nImani Gandy at RH Reality Check pointed out that this type of language is standard in legal responses to wrongful death lawsuits. But the connotations of the defense still greatly offended people, particularly the Rice family that had already lost a 12-year-old son. \\\\nLoehmann shot Rice while he carried a toy airsoft gun on November 22, and Rice died at the hospital the following day. Video of the incident shows police officers arriving to the park where Rice was playing, and Loehmann shooting the boy within two seconds of getting out of the car. \\\\nPrior to the incident, a 911 caller told a dispatcher that a child was waving a gun around in the park but that it was \"probably fake.\" The full information was not relayed to officers, according to authorities. \\\\nPolice said, according to Cleveland.com, that Rice was sitting under a pavilion in the park with a few people, suggesting that the boy could have been a threat to others. But the video footage shows Rice was sitting alone as police pulled up. \\\\nThe Associated Press reported that police also claimed that the officer who opened fire on Rice asked the boy to put his hands up three times, suggesting that Rice was given ample warning before he was shot. The video footage doesn't disprove this, but it suggests that Loehmann would have given the commands fairly quickly, since he shot Rice within two seconds of his squad car pulling up to the park pavilion. \\\\nCleveland's original response to the lawsuit also claimed that the city was not aware of Loehmann's troubled history at other police departments. Loehmann resigned from the Independence, Ohio, Police Department in 2012 after he was deemed unfit for duty, in part because he couldn't properly handle a firearm. Other records reported by Cleveland.com showed that Loehmann failed the written entrance exam in 2013 for the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department. He also reportedly failed to get hired at police departments in Akron, Euclid, and Parma Heights after he left Independence. \\\\nThe city of Cleveland, which handed the shooting investigation to the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office for a more independent process, said it can't respond to some of the lawsuit's claims in full because the county's investigation into the shooting isn't completed. \\\\nThe county is currently investigating the Rice shooting and presenting the evidence to a grand jury. The Rice family separately filed a lawsuit against the city for the shooting. \\\\nFurther reading: Cleveland police shot and killed black 12-year-old Tamir Rice as he carried a toy gun.:    1  \n",
       "           \\\\nThis week, former President Bill Clinton taped an interview for the Rachael Ray Show — and Ray caught him flat-footed with a hard-hitting question he clearly had no response to. \"There is a possibility that you will return to the White House yet again,\" Ray said. \"I really wanna know, what would you then be called? Would you be ‘First Fella?' Would you be 'Mr. and Mrs. Presidents?'\" \\\\nClinton was unprepared, and began by answering an unrelated question, saying, \"If the president is a man, you call the president's spouse the First Lady, so we'll have to cross this bridge if a gay couple ever\" enters the White House. Then he tried to offer his own response, with a Bible joke: \"But let's say, if a woman became president — I could be called Adam. The first man? I don't know.\"  \\\\nRay and the crowd laughed far too hard given the quality of the joke. For some other possibilities, including \"First Gentleman\" and \"First Husband,\" check out this rundown from Jaime Fuller.

       "           \\\\nA state representative from Alabama wrote a Facebook post this weekend in which she threatened to expose the affairs of politicians trying to restore the state's ban on same-sex marriage, Kent Faulk of AL.com reports. \\\\nState Rep. Patricia Todd (D) — the first openly gay legislator elected in Alabama — had praised a federal judge's January 23 ruling striking down the ban. But when the House Speaker and Attorney General argued that a higher court should stay the order, Todd posted this on Facebook: \\\\n \\\\n\"This (is) a time where you find out who are accepting, loving people. To say I am disappointed in Speaker Hubbard comment's and Attorney General Strange choice to appeal the decision is an understatement. I will not stand by and allow legislators to talk about 'family values' when they have affairs, and I know of many who are and have. I will call our elected officials who want to hide in the closet OUT\" \\\\n \\\\nLater, Todd stood by her unusual threat, arguing that the circumstances called for it, as you can see in the video up top. \"Think about all the people in this room, and all the love that you feel for each other and these couples who are about to make history of being the first couples married in the state of Alabama,\" she said. \"We have families that will now be legitimized overnight. Children who will be affected and be able to call both parents 'mom' or 'dad.'\" \\\\n\"This is the fight of our life. This is why I ran for office.\" \\\\nTodd continued: \"That's a true family value. Many of you all know that I have thrown the gauntlet down to my elected peers that should they decide to go and spout that family value, then I'm gonna call 'em out. And I'm willing to jeopardize my political campaign to do it. This is the fight of our life. This is why I ran for office. I'm not a politician, I'm an activist.\" \\\\nA district court judge has issued a short-term stay on the Alabama ruling, pending appellate court action — so same-sex couples can't currently marry in the state. If the appellate court takes no action by February 9, the lower court ruling striking down the same-sex marriage ban will go into effect.

       "           \\\\nFBI Director James Comey gave a speech Thursday acknowledging the \"hard truths\" about racial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system. \\\\nComey spoke frankly about improving the police's relationship with young black men: \\\\n \\\\nThose of us in law enforcement must redouble our efforts to resist bias and prejudice. We must better understand the people we serve and protect. By trying to know, deep in our gut, what it feels like to be a law-abiding, young black man walking down the street and encountering law enforcement. We must understand how that young man may see us. We must resist the lazy shortcomings of cynicism. \\\\n \\\\nComey's speech attempted to invoke a middle ground in recent debates about racial disparities. He argued that police officers \"are overwhelmingly doing the right thing for the right reasons.\" But he also said he's not trying to \"let law enforcement off the hook.\" \\\\nComey said police must develop processes to overcome their subconscious biases against minority groups. Research shows this bias is real: studies prove that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado at Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research, previously said it's possible the bias could lead to more skewed outcomes in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" he said, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\" \\\\nComey also argued that the FBI and police must improve the ways they collect data on arrests and shootings, echoing a call made by US Attorney General Eric Holder. Currently, the federal government doesn't collect comprehensive data on people killed by police or officers killed in attacks. The FBI gathers some data, but the figures are generally viewed as the minimum numbers, since reporting by police departments is voluntary. \\\\nRacial disparities in police use of force and the criminal justice system have received a lot of attention in the past year, particularly after the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. The shooting of Brown set off a  nationwide movement to raise awareness about the death of young black men, under the banner, \"Black Lives Matter.\" \\\\nComey's full speech is available at the FBI's website. \\\\nVideo taken from Time magazine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              :    1  \n",
       "           \\\\nThe city of Cleveland argued in court that Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy, caused his own death when a police officer shot and killed him after mistaking Rice's pellet gun for an actual firearm. But following criticisms over the accusation, city officials apologized and vowed to change the language in a future court document. \\\\n\"This is not the character or personality of the city of Cleveland … to be that insensitive to family or even to victims,\" Cleveland Mayor Frank  Jackson said at a news conference on Monday, Cleveland.com reported. \\\\nThe city originally presented the argument in a court document responding to a lawsuit from the Rice family. The response stated that Rice's death was caused \"by the failure … to exercise due care to avoid injury,\" according to Cleveland.com. It also said that all of the injuries claimed by his family \"were directly and proximately caused by their own acts,\" not Timothy Loehmann, the officer who fatally shot Rice. \\\\nThe city claimed Rice's death was caused \"by the failure ... to exercise due care to avoid injury\" \\\\nImani Gandy at RH Reality Check pointed out that this type of language is standard in legal responses to wrongful death lawsuits. But the connotations of the defense still greatly offended people, particularly the Rice family that had already lost a 12-year-old son. \\\\nLoehmann shot Rice while he carried a toy airsoft gun on November 22, and Rice died at the hospital the following day. Video of the incident shows police officers arriving to the park where Rice was playing, and Loehmann shooting the boy within two seconds of getting out of the car. \\\\nPrior to the incident, a 911 caller told a dispatcher that a child was waving a gun around in the park but that it was \"probably fake.\" The full information was not relayed to officers, according to authorities. \\\\nPolice said, according to Cleveland.com, that Rice was sitting under a pavilion in the park with a few people, suggesting that the boy could have been a threat to others. But the video footage shows Rice was sitting alone as police pulled up. \\\\nThe Associated Press reported that police also claimed that the officer who opened fire on Rice asked the boy to put his hands up three times, suggesting that Rice was given ample warning before he was shot. The video footage doesn't disprove this, but it suggests that Loehmann would have given the commands fairly quickly, since he shot Rice within two seconds of his squad car pulling up to the park pavilion. \\\\nCleveland's original response to the lawsuit also claimed that the city was not aware of Loehmann's troubled history at other police departments. Loehmann resigned from the Independence, Ohio, Police Department in 2012 after he was deemed unfit for duty, in part because he couldn't properly handle a firearm. Other records reported by Cleveland.com showed that Loehmann failed the written entrance exam in 2013 for the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department. He also reportedly failed to get hired at police departments in Akron, Euclid, and Parma Heights after he left Independence. \\\\nThe city of Cleveland, which handed the shooting investigation to the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office for a more independent process, said it can't respond to some of the lawsuit's claims in full because the county's investigation into the shooting isn't completed. \\\\nThe county is currently investigating the Rice shooting and presenting the evidence to a grand jury. The Rice family separately filed a lawsuit against the city for the shooting. \\\\nFurther reading: Cleveland police shot and killed black 12-year-old Tamir Rice as he carried a toy gun.:    1  \n",
       "           \\\\nThis week, former President Bill Clinton taped an interview for the Rachael Ray Show — and Ray caught him flat-footed with a hard-hitting question he clearly had no response to. \"There is a possibility that you will return to the White House yet again,\" Ray said. \"I really wanna know, what would you then be called? Would you be ‘First Fella?' Would you be 'Mr. and Mrs. Presidents?'\" \\\\nClinton was unprepared, and began by answering an unrelated question, saying, \"If the president is a man, you call the president's spouse the First Lady, so we'll have to cross this bridge if a gay couple ever\" enters the White House. Then he tried to offer his own response, with a Bible joke: \"But let's say, if a woman became president — I could be called Adam. The first man? I don't know.\"  \\\\nRay and the crowd laughed far too hard given the quality of the joke. For some other possibilities, including \"First Gentleman\" and \"First Husband,\" check out this rundown from Jaime Fuller.

       "    \\\\n \\\\nDeadpool is getting a sequel. That's impressive, given that the movie — which is led by an actor who hasn't had a box office smash since 2009 — earned a follow-up film before it was even released, and thus before it made a single penny on American soil. On the surface, it sounds like blazing insanity on Fox's part. \\\\nBut it isn't. Not even close. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\nRelated Review: Deadpool isn't reinventing the superhero genre. It's making it better.\\\\n \\\\nThe studio's confidence in Deadpool stems from the character's unique place in the Marvel Universe. Unlike Iron Man or Thor or Captain America, Deadpool goes into his own movie as one of company's most popular heroes and one of its most visible personalities. He appears in quite a few different comics; one minute he's helping the Avengers take on Red Skull, the next he's using a shoryuken on Kitty Pryde, and after that he's hanging out with Cable and Spider-Man. He's a frequent (some might even say overexposed) guest star in other heroes' stories, but he also gets the spotlight his own books. \\\\nDeadpool, a.k.a. Wade Wilson, has a healing ability that rivals that of Wolverine and looks like what would happen if psoriasis had psoriasis — the result of an experiment, performed in desperation in response to terminal cancer, gone awry. It's not a terribly unique origin story. \\\\nAnd while his raunchy humor and cynicism are what the character has become known for, Deadpool also represents something unique to comic books: He's part of a narrative that's run continually for 25 years and has changed and adapted in different ways, under different writers and artists along the way. \\\\nHow Deadpool came to be \\\\nThe key to understanding Deadpool is to understand the era in which he was created. Deadpool makes his first comic appearance in 1991's New Mutants No. 98, by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist-writer Rob Liefeld. When we first meet him, he's ready to \"frost\" Cable's \"mechanical butt\": \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nNew Mutants No. 98. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nLiefeld's Deadpool looks like a red fire ant on growth hormones; I'm not sure what's going on with the undulating sack of \"muscles\" in his legs. Eventually, we would learn of Deadpool's participation in a complicated plot involving a former girlfriend who had infiltrated X-Force, an offshoot of mutants and the X-Men franchise. But right here, in this debut moment, we understand that he's a mercenary who isn't afraid to kill people. And that already reveals a lot. \\\\nBecause when it comes to superheroes, violence is personal. \\\\nWhether a superhero is willing to kill people is one of the biggest tells in comics. The concept is simple: Villains are expected to kill with reckless abandon, and heroes are not. Showing restraint and not killing someone, even though that person may have done a lot of fucked-up stuff, is what defines a hero. Those are the goalposts. \\\\nAnd the stories where heroes do kill — like when Wonder Woman kills Maxwell Lord in Wonder Woman No. 219 or Fantomex kills a reincarnation of Apocalypse in Uncanny X-Force No. 4 — are major turning points in terms of those heroes' morality. \\\\nRight off the bat, Deadpool seemingly has no conscience, which sets off all the alarms that he's a villain. But there's something else in play here, and it's that Deadpool is a reflection of his era's major comic book trends. \\\\nLike a tween who has just discovered Slayer or Megadeth, in the '90s comics began to shift toward edgier, more violent, and more sexualized stories. At the time, there was also a shift toward graphic violence in other pockets of culture, including video games (think Mortal Kombat) and movies (like Natural Born Killers). \\\\nBut the shift in comics was seen as a response to the years of stories published under the Comics Code, a set of editorial standards — good always triumphs over evil, nothing overtly sexual, no gore — the industry imposed on itself to keep comics clean and parents happy. It allowed for a continuation of the themes in Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore's The Watchmen — two darker, edgier stories that dissected the idea of the superhero. \\\\nCreators quickly embraced the trend, which led to the creation of Image Comics — Liefeld actually left Marvel in 1992 and co-founded the company, whose flagship hero, Spawn, was more violent than Marvel or DC's characters could be. Image's other comics, like The Savage Dragon, Witchblade, and Gen 13 were also popular, and they artistically stretched the boundaries of how comic books depicted sex and violence. \\\\nDeadpool was created at the beginning of this spurt. It's why he talks about killing and uses slang, which at the time was hipper than it is now. And we know from Liefeld's subsequent work at Image that he'd always wanted to push for edgier stuff but didn't finish that vision with Nicienza and Deadpool. \\\\nHow Deadpool became the character we know today \\\\nDeadpool has undergone many changes throughout the years. Right from the start, he was something different from Marvel's stable of characters, thanks to his violence and edge. He had the grit of the X-Men — who were immensely popular at the time — but allowed writers and artists a vehicle to push further beyond their territory. \\\\nHowever, what would ultimately set Deadpool apart, and allow him to progress past the hyperviolence of the '90s, was his ability for breaking the fourth wall. \\\\nDeadpool began to take his current form in 1997, when writer Joe Kelly and artist Ed McGuinness began the Deadpool solo series. The shift was predicated by a copious amount of freedom granted by a general lack of editorial interest in the character. \\\\n\"With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be canceled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention,\" Kelly told Newsarama in 2009. \"And we could get away with it.\" \\\\nThe \"anything\" Kelly is talking about is Deadpool's unhinged, fourth-wall-breaking personality. During Kelly and McGuinness's reign, he not only spoke to the audience frequently, he also became something of a cypher, pointing out the ridiculousness of the superhero genre and reflecting readers' own thoughts and ideas back onto the page. \\\\nGuinness's style complemented Deadpool's sarcastic tone, as there was a jokey, almost friendly aspect to the comic. The shapes were rounder, the characters more cartoonish, and the art belied Deadpool's seriousness and violence: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nDeadpool No. 4. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nFor example, in Deadpool No. 4, he mocks Stan Lee's \"true believer\" catchphrase and addresses his readers directly. Then, later in the comic, he has a psychotic breakdown where you can't tell who he's addressing: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nDeadpool No. 4. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nKelly used the psychotic voices in Deadpool's head and his habit of breaking the fourth wall to set the tone for the character. On one hand, Deadpool was smarter than the rest of the characters in the book because he was self-aware. On the other hand, you couldn't really trust him because of his deep psychological scars. \\\\nIn the comics industry, Deadpool offered a unique viewpoint and voice. However, despite their groundbreaking work, the Kelly-McGuinness collaboration didn't chart that well, usually hovering around the 30s on the comics best-seller list. Kelly eventually left the comic. But what he and McGuinness started stuck with the character. \\\\nIn Kelly and McGuinness's hands, Deadpool was less serious. To be clear, less serious doesn't mean bad or not smart. But if you compare Deadpool's storylines to some of the X-Men storylines of the '90s (e.g., the Legacy Virus, an allegory for the AIDS epidemic), the character wasn't entrenched in the same kind of somberness. \\\\nA writer named Christopher Priest stepped in at the tail end of 1999 with Deadpool No. 35. And right away, some of the elements that Kelly introduced — self-awareness, irreverence, talking to the audience — were fleshed out and expanded upon. Priest started grafting the reader-addressing, gory bits of Deadpool onto the character's bones, making them prominent and inescapable. And we started to see heightened satirical, often violent sequences like the one below, from issue 38, where Deadpool tries in vain to scar himself to break Loki's curse: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nDeadpool No. 38. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nThis is just a nifty, funny way that Deadpool subverts and spoofs the idea of the super healing trope. When you encounter characters in comic books who can heal, it's usually in battle; chances are they're beat to a pulp and come back and end up doing something triumphant. Deadpool and his writer and artist are satirizing that, but still getting the point across. \\\\nThis signature mix of humor, brevity, and physical violence would fade when Priest left the comic 2000 with issue 45, but was brought back by writer Gail Simone and main artist Udon Studios in Deadpool No. 65: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nDeadpool No. 65. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nWhat originally began with Moore and Miller's dark and well-executed tales in The Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns eventually cascaded into an era of very serious, gritty comic books and storylines that grew popular due to their propensity for violence and the macabre. But that style eventually became monotonous, because every creator was jumping on that bandwagon. Deadpool represented something different and lighter — something that was still plenty violent, but that people could laugh at. \\\\nDeadpool's humor and self-awareness are what make the character unique. They're what give him continuity and imbue him with longevity beyond the cynical, gritty hyperviolence of the '90s. He was created during the trend, but managed to outlast it by cutting against it. \\\\nAnd slowly, Marvel and the men and women creating Deadpool began to realize that his humor was the most necessary part of the character who'd become known to many as the \"Merc With a Mouth.\" \\\\nDeadpool has a heart, sort of \\\\nIf I were to pick one page from the past six months of comics that perfectly represents what Deadpool is like today, it would be the first page of Spider-Man/Deadpool No. 1, written by none other than Joe Kelly and drawn by Ed McGuinness: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nSpider-Man/Deadpool No. 1. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nSpider-Man and Deadpool are tangled in a web, hanging upside down over a sea of bad guys. And in this very dramatic moment, Deadpool is joking about how the friction of his leather and Spider-Man's wriggling is turning him on. It's hilarious, queer, weird, and sarcastic, but it's not done at anyone's expense, except for maybe the all-too-serious Spider-Man. That page is a full realization and embrace of Deadpool's quirks and self-awareness, but it's also indicative of how the character is currently being written. \\\\nIn the past few years, there's been a push to make Deadpool funny but also to establish his moral compass. It adds another layer of depth to the character. Deadpool can be funny, irreverent, and murderous. But Marvel wanted to emphasize the idea that behind all of his outrageousness, Deadpool has a soul. And so we began to get flashes of Deadpool framed as a tragic figure. \\\\nIn 2010, he was part of writer Rick Remender and main artist Jerome Opeña's Uncanny X-Force — a black ops group of X-Men (and allies) who do what the X-Men can't (mainly by killing). Deadpool, being a mercenary, should've been a seamless fit with the group. \\\\nBut in the first arc, the X-Force must face a reincarnation of the villain Apocalypse, who happens to be a child. And one of its members, Fantomex, guns him down. The incident rattles Deadpool to his core, and he ends up clashing with the team: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nUncanny X-Force No. 5. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nIt's a heartbreaking moment, not only because we see Deadpool deal with the trauma, but also because it shows what the rest of the team thinks of him. That team is composed of X-Men, who are supposed to be protecting the people shunned by society. They're supposed to be \"better\" people than Deadpool, but he's the only one who's showing remorse. \\\\nWolverine doesn't see Deadpool as a person, claiming that Deadpool is just with the X-Force for the money. But it's later revealed that Deadpool hasn't been cashing his checks. \\\\nPerhaps it's because Deadpool is lonely, but he enjoyed being part of the group. So leaving it was not only a big deal for him, it also showed there are some things he takes seriously. \\\\nThis is hammered home in Marvel's 2014 AXIS crossover event (also penned by Remender), where Apocalypse and Deadpool confront each other in battle: \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nAvengers & X-Men: Axis No. 7. (Marvel) \\\\n \\\\nDeadpool, healing abilities and all, is no match for Apocalypse, who is now all grown up. Apocalypse thrashes Deadpool while he pleads — knowing that Apocalypse is capable of being better. The scene underscores Deadpool's sense of morality and calls back to his tangled time with the X-Force. Now, it's important to note that the complicated storyline involves villains and heroes getting their personalities inverted, but there's a sense that Deadpool (who refers to himself as Zenpool) still holds on to some of that kid murder trauma. \\\\nIt's strange to compare this modern Deadpool, a dirty-joke-throwing, tragic mercenary with a rigid sense of morality, to the Deadpool we first met some 25 years ago. His humor becomes a defense mechanism, and beneath the mask is a character who struggles with his own humanity. He's certainly grown up in the past 25 years. And the comic-reading audience has, too. \\\\nWhy we root for Deadpool \\\\nWhen people try to explain fans' love for Deadpool and the new Deadpool movie (in theaters now), it usually goes like this: \"He tells dirty jokes, kills shit, and yells stuff about tacos, and dudes love him for it.\" And maybe that's true for some fans and some iterations of the character. But that's a terribly compressed view of the hero and his fans. \\\\nEven if you don't read Deadpool comics religiously or subscribe to his sense of humor, you can still appreciate the way the character has evolved throughout the years. That type of evolution for any kind of fictional character — the ability for different writers and artists to interpret the character and push him to be better over a continuous 25-year narrative — is typically only possible in comic books. \\\\nAnd the fantastic part is that he's still changing, one inappropriate joke at a time. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLearn more \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nThe insane, sexist

       "    \\\\n \\\\nThis spring, I met Claire McCormack and Thomas Boström at their house in northern California for a lengthy and difficult conversation about their daughter, Nora, who had died just before her fourth birthday after experiencing four central line infections. Some consider these infections (of which there were nearly 10,000 in 2013) an unavoidable risk, but others think they are preventable with better safety protocols in hospitals. \\\\nMy research led to a story called \"Do No Harm,\" which we ran today, about how hospitals react to hurting patients. For the story, I traveled to California to meet Claire, visit hospitals, talk with nurses, and observe the type of work that's necessary to make our health-care system safer. \\\\nVox's video producer Johnny Harris was with me the entire time, shooting for the story and also capturing still images. Here's a look behind the scenes of our trip. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI spent a total of five hours interviewing Claire McCormack (above, with the letter) and her husband and Nora's dad, Thomas Boström, at their house in late April. We talked a lot about Nora's case and reviewed correspondence with her hospital. (Johnny Harris/Vox) \\\\n \\\\nClaire showed me a set of collages that a friend had made for Nora's funeral, in November 2013, which she now keeps in the family's living room. (Johnny Harris/Vox) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeft: Johnny shot a video of Claire talking about Nora's death, one of the hardest parts of the interview. Right: We also met Magnus, Claire and Thomas's infant son. (Johnny Harris/Vox) \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nIn this picture I'm at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, where Nora died. Claire and Thomas filed a malpractice lawsuit against Packard, and a spokesperson there declined to comment on our story due to the ongoing litigation. But Johnny and I did visit the hospital to see the space where Nora was treated. (Johnny Harris/Vox) \\\\n \\\\nSutter Roseville Medical Center is three hours north of Packard, and it went seven years without a central line infection. Deborah Dix (right), a nurse who directs oncology care at the hospital, walked me through the multi-step checklist her team uses to prevent infections when inserting and accessing a central line. (Johnny Harris/Vox) \\\\n \\\\nThe thing that struck me most about watching the Roseville nurses insert a central line was their meticulousness: how they had a set number of safety steps in their protocol and followed them to a T. And they seemed to work from muscle memory; their only job is to insert and manage central lines, so they know the steps by heart.

But once we’re underwater, I can see the rows and rows of PVC trees, suspended above the sand in a grid that stretches away into the distant murk. \\\\nThis is a coral nursery. Each tree bears a ripening crop of a hundred or more pieces of coral. The smallest fragments are pinkie-sized, twirling on their tethers as other divers kick by; the largest hang like many-limbed chandeliers, turning slowly in the current. When I get closer, I can see the individual polyps, the anemone-like creatures that make up each fragmented colony. Nestled in the crenellated openings in their solid skeletons, they are waving their fleshy tentacles through the water, feeding. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nGlobal warming, explained\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nWe are there to tend the trees: Each one needs to be surveyed, scrubbed of algae, and have its biggest corals subdivided into new cuttings. Any coral bleached by high temperatures or damaged by disease needs to be removed to a nearby heap. This is a daunting task considering that the Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF) maintains five coral nurseries with some 40,000 corals growing on trees just like these ones, all along the spattered arc of the Florida Keys. \\\\nExaggerating her gestures, a woman named Patty shows us — a group of long-time volunteers and visiting divers — how to hang new cuttings in place of the corals we cut down. We exhale long streamers of air back toward the surface, and move slowly as we pass the shared pliers around, cutting and crimping monofilament with the slow-motion care of astronauts maneuvering in zero gravity. \\\\nI pick up a piece of coral, maybe eight inches long and forked at both ends. It’s a deep amber, except for the bright white tips of its branches. It’s hard to tell how heavy an object is underwater, but this one feels light: A small thing to pin the reef’s future on. I tag it with the name and number of its tree, and drop it into a milk crate with the others we’ve harvested. \\\\nNow it’s time to go plant a reef. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nI got here with a question: What happens to coral reefs as the ocean warms and acidifies over the coming century? Corals might seem removed from human society, but in fact that not-so-simple question leads to an even scarier follow-up: What happens to us? \\\\nCoral reefs are the richest ocean ecosystems we have — they support an estimated 25 percent of marine species. According to a 2014 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization, reefs are responsible for 17 percent of the protein we consume globally; in some coastal or island countries, like Sierra Leone or the Maldives, that number can be as high as 70 percent. Reefs serve as offshore larders, nurseries for important commercial fish (like tuna), and shelter for important ecological species (like sharks). They’re storm breaks for populated shores and bait for tourists whose dollars support entire local economies. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nWe know that reefs are crucial to the oceans as we know them, and to our societies as we’ve made them — and we know they are in serious trouble. According to one 2000 report, we’ve lost 27 percent of coral worldwide, and stand to lose another 32 percent in the next 30 years. \\\\nWhat we don’t know is if there’s anything we can do about it. Luckily, that won’t stop people from trying: Around the world, a scrappy handful of scientists, entrepreneurs, and volunteers are taking on this colossal problem, one branch at a time. \\\\nFrom regrowing the reefs we’ve already lost to engineering new corals that may be able to survive hotter, more acidic seas, these innovators are fighting everything from nutrient pollution to overfishing to ocean warming itself. If we want to succeed, we might have to learn how to rebuild an entire ecosystem from the bottom up. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nPart 1 \\\\nRestoration \\\\nWhat is a coral, really? It’s an animal, but it is also plantlike, an alien amalgam of many clades. It is made up of minuscule individuals and yet its colonies comprise the largest living structures in the natural world. \\\\nZooming in reveals the tiny components and processes that make up the organism: the fleshy coral polyp within its calcium carbonate skeleton; the microscopic algae that live in symbiosis inside the cells of the animal; the complex microbial communities that live in and around all of them. You’d also observe the way ocean chemistry interacts intimately with the creatures, changing their ability to grow, or the way a half-degree difference in temperature can upset their delicately balanced cellular machinery. \\\\nZooming out to the reefs themselves reveals geological structures reaching up from the seafloor, growing from millions of tiny mouths and built on the compiled skeletons of previous generations. These house fish and sea urchins that graze on the algae that might otherwise overgrow the corals, larger fish that eat them, and species like sharks, whose existence marks a well-balanced ecosystem and whose absence indicates disorder. Other organisms prey on the coral itself: The crown-of-thorns starfish is so fecund and insatiable that a single individual can populate whole square miles of reef, stripping the coral of its polyps and leaving dead, white skeletons behind. \\\\nHumans have a way of messing with coral at both ends of the scale, from altering the very chemistry of the water they grow in, to destroying thousands of miles of reef by dredging, polluting, overfishing, and just generally overloading them. \\\\nBut some people think that in order to fix coral, we’ll have to keep meddling. We’ll just have to do it better. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\nThe Coral Restoration Foundation’s nursery is made up of PVC-pipe \"trees\" where corals grow quickly in the nutrient-rich current. \\\\n \\\\nKen Nedimyer, founder of the Coral Restoration Foundation, leans hard on the coral-as-trees metaphor. If you can regrow a forest from a nursery, he thought, why not a reef? Aside from a few frustrating particulars and unknowns about coral husbandry, the model made sense to him. But no one had tried it. \\\\nIn 40 years of diving in the Florida Keys, Nedimyer has watched the place change into something unrecognizable: \"The reefs I saw in the early ‘70s were just fabulous. I remember going to Carysfort, and it was just acres and acres of elkhorn coral, coming right to the surface. You couldn’t swim over it; you couldn’t see the end of it. Most of the reefs in the Florida Keys were like that.\" \\\\nAs the stepping-stone islands filled up with people, the surrounding seas filled up with their boats and sewage. Until very recently, wastewater from the Florida Keys was flushed right out to sea or pumped into leaky septic systems. As a result, all those spectacular near-shore reefs that had made the place famous suffered a 30-year-long string of disease outbreaks, algal blooms, dredging, damage from boats, and overfishing. Today, the Carysfort Reef has mostly turned to skeletal rubble, overgrown with algae and largely empty of fish. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nThe problem with coral in the Keys is not unique in the Caribbean. A comprehensive study of the Caribbean’s reefs from 1972 to 2012 found that coral declined by more than 80 percent, with most of that loss concentrated in the ’80s and ’90s. An outbreak of White Band Disease knocked out almost all of the region’s staghorn and elkhorn corals — the branching corals that make up the bulk of the region’s reef structure. Another disease wiped out the local sea urchins that kept algae in check. Then in 1997 and 1998, the strongest-ever El Niño observed to date hit, and ocean temperatures shot up. Caribbean corals, struggling in the hot water, expelled their symbiotic algae and slowly starved to death, in some of the worst bleaching events in the history. \\\\nIn the late ’90s, a series of papers proclaimed the end of reefs, eventual or imminent. Even if we could stop dumping so much (literal) shit and sludge on the reefs, we almost certainly couldn’t stop the global warming that had already started raising ocean temperatures above the threshold at which coral survival seemed impossible. Surely these fragile creatures, the foundation for so many critical ecosystems, would not be able to exist in that hot future world. Surely, they were all doomed. \\\\nBut what seemed like a foregone conclusion to pessimistic scientists seemed like a call to arms for others. Nedimyer was of the latter. An aquarium collector, he spent most of his time underwater, catching tropical fish to sell to public and private aquariums. When an elkhorn coral started to grow on some aquarium \"live rock\" he was tending, Nedimyer had an idea. While elkhorn is a federally protected species in the Caribbean, the law was that anything growing on Ken’s live rock — including elkhorn — belonged to him. He could do what he wanted with it. \\\\nNedimyer knew he could probably make a tidy fortune by growing the rare coral to sell cuttings to aquariums. But he wanted to do something bigger. So Nedimyer and his 13-year-old daughter started with a 4H project, fragmenting the original coral to grow each piece into a new colony. They were practicing for the nursery Nedimyer had pictured, an enormous underwater forest capable of restoring the Caribbean’s reefs to their former state, the way he had known them 40 years before. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\nA thicket of transplanted staghorn coral takes root in the Florida Keys. \\\\n \\\\nIn 2003, Nedimyer got federal permission to plant six corals in a spot on Molasses Reef in the Florida Keys. In 2007, after a string of bad luck and hurricanes that kept them off the reef, they planted 18. In 2015, Nedimyer and the small staff of the Coral Restoration Foundation, along with a legion of volunteers, have planted more than 18,000 of them. \\\\nJessica Levy manages the CRF’s restoration program, which means she is out on the water most days — gathering corals from the nurseries, monitoring for signs of trouble, and planting new batches of coral on the reef. The corals she works with are the offspring of wild patches of elkhorn and staghorn that survived the mass die-offs of the last few decades. \\\\n\"If they’ve gone through bleaching events and survived, if they’ve gone through cold events and survived, they’re a stronger coral,\" Levy says. \"They’re the ones that you want to fragment and grow and plant back on the reef. The idea being, if they survived it then, they’ll survive it now.\" \\\\nIn the nursery, coral grow two or three times faster than they grow on the reef. Suspended in the water column, they can gather nutrients from the current and grow in all directions without expending energy to affix themselves to the reef. Once planted, they spend a few months stabilizing, forming new tissue over the epoxy used to cement them in place. Then they start growing again. \\\\nSince they’re planted in groups of the same genotype, the corals grow together as they get bigger, forming tangled thickets that provide the kind of shelter and support a reef so badly needs. Levy says that, so far, about 80 percent of the transplants are still alive after two years on the reef. Impressive results, especially considering no one has ever tried a project like this at scale before. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\nA volunteer coordinator for CRF readies a boatload of divers. \\\\n \\\\nNevertheless, Nedimyer and Levy and the rest of CRF know they are facing a Herculean task if they expect to replant all of Florida’s reefs by hand. But, luckily, they don’t. Even the reefs where they’ve been planting corals since the beginning are still mostly bare, featuring the odd thicket of staghorn or stubborn boulder coral. \\\\nLevy says CRF’s real goal is not to repopulate the reefs coral by coral, but to preserve the genetic diversity the species needs to stay resilient. By gathering corals from the reef, CRF can save genotypes that might otherwise be lost from the wild. Eventually, if CRF can just boost population density a little, the corals can start reproducing on their own again. \\\\n\"One of the biggest obstacles is that as these populations stand now, when they do go to spawn, they’re so far apart,\" Levy points out. Corals are hermaphroditic, producing bundles of both sperm and eggs during a yearly spawning event, but elkhorn and staghorn can’t fertilize themselves. They trust that their spawn will mingle in the water column, meet other coral spawn, fertilize, and avoid being eaten long enough to settle out and start growing new coral. But right now, says Levy, \"these guys are so fragmented that there’s no chance of meeting up.\" \\\\n\"It’s a big ocean. The goal was never to outplant every coral on every reef. That’s not sustainable,\" Levy says, on a rare day in her office on land. That’s the part that can be hard to explain to people, who can’t see the point of scattering a few thousand corals across reefs that once hosted millions. \"The goal is to get genetic diversity out there, to the point where they’re naturally reproducing. Basically, to boost natural recovery.\" \\\\nIf that sounds like a big gamble to you — it is. But it might be our best bet. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTo plant a coral, you first have to clear a place for it. You do this (I am a little alarmed to learn) with the chisel end of a hammer. \\\\nThe day after we gathered our coral cuttings from the nursery, we go out on Molasses Reef, one of the most visited reefs in the Keys. I take a hammer from Patty and tentatively begin tapping the reef substrate, a compressed residue of coral rubble and sand, riddled with strange, iridescent sea worms. \\\\nThis is not easy. Picture an astronaut trying to hammer a nail in space: For every fraction of an inch the nail goes in, the astronaut floats back a foot. In my case, each careful chisel blow to the rock sends me drifting upward like an untethered balloon. To stay down, I have to direct my head and all my attention downward while kicking steadily, as I scrape the rock clear of its algal fuzz. \\\\nI brace my coral firmly against a spot on the cleared substrate with one hand, while with the other I pinch off small globs of purple epoxy. Each branch gets a dab, and the whole thing goes down onto the spot I’ve cleared. \\\\nAt least in theory: Between my own drift and wafting clouds of sediment from the divers chiseling on either side of me, it takes some maneuvering before I can get my branch of staghorn anchored firmly to the rock. To test its structural integrity, I wave my hand over it like I’m trying to fan out a flame. Sediment flies up in a cloud, but my coral — it stays put. Success. \\\\nIt takes about 40 minutes for four of us to plant all 10 corals in one thicket, an area easily encompassed by a hula-hoop. As all the groups start to ascend, I can’t help but think that it doesn’t look like much. Together, we have managed to plant a single milk-crate’s worth of corals over a badminton court-sized patch of seafloor. This on the bare, rocky remains of a reef that stretches to the limits of visibility. \\\\nBut something happens as we continue to rise. Fish dart in to fill the space we have made, rushing to gulp the worms we’ve dislodged in all that scraping and hammering. Suddenly, our sad jumble of coral looks a lot more like a habitat. \\\\nFrom 20 feet above the sea floor, I can see thickets of staghorn planted in the previous year or so. I can see how the disparate pieces of coral have grown up and together, knitting their branches into a kind of a dome. I can see, finally, where they have grown over the epoxy lumps that first sealed them to the reef. They have already taken root. \\\\nPart 2 \\\\nSelection \\\\nOn a tiny island called Ofu, part of American Samoa just south of the equator and east of the International Date Line, corals are doing something that might have once seemed impossible. \\\\nUnder the intense heat of the southern sun, in a shallow lagoon where water temperatures can reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit, coral reefs are thriving. While corals elsewhere struggle when water temperatures reach the mid ’80s, these equatorial corals can handle the extra degrees without breaking a sweat. Those are the kinds of water temperatures people expect to see by the end of this century, which means, in a sense, Ofu’s corals are already living in the future. \\\\nMarine biologist Steve Palumbi wants to find out how these corals are so chill about extreme heat. A researcher at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, Palumbi wanted to know if these outlying \"supercorals\" could hold the key to a secret resiliency available to all corals. \\\\n\"Corals live in a very variable environment and they have for millions of years,\" Palumbi tells me one afternoon, in his office in Monterey, Calif. \"So it stands to reason that perhaps, in corals that live right now, there are already some that have adapted to live in future environments.\" \\\\n\\\\n \\\\nThickets of coral growing in the super-heated water off of Ofu, in American Samoa. \\\\n \\\\nSo Palumbi took a team of researchers and students to Ofu to put the supercorals through their paces. He chose to focus on a type of Acropora — the same genus that includes elkhorn and staghorn corals — called tabletop corals. As their name suggests, they grow in broad, table-like ledges, gathering as much solar energy as they can and providing shelter and shade for other species. \\\\nFast-growing and generally susceptible to heat extremes, Acropora are both a fundamental builder of reef architecture and usually one of the more fragile species on the reef. If Ofu’s tabletops seemed hardier than usual, Palumbi was determined to find out why. \\\\nUsing portable water coolers (the kind you’d use to stash a couple six-packs at a picnic) rigged with heating and refrigerating elements, the researchers took fragments of coral from the reef and subjected them to a uniform battery of stress tests. As the temperatures inched up, and the corals became more and more stressed, they started to expel the photosynthetic algae they need to live, and eventually bleached. \\\\nHere’s what’s interesting: The corals the researchers chose for testing came from different parts of the same reef, some of which experienced much higher temperatures on a regular basis. These \"warm-adjusted\" corals were much less likely to bleach under high temperatures than those that came from cooler parts of the reef. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nThere are two mechanisms by which these corals (or any organism really) can adjust to an extreme environment — increased temperature, for example. The first, acclimation, is a short-term process whereby individual organisms change their physiology to become more heat tolerant. Then there’s adaptation, the longer-term process of natural selection whereby certain individuals pass on the genetic traits that make them more successful in warmer environments. \\\\nIn other words: Acclimation is the tan you get on vacation, while adaptation is the skin tone you’re born with. In both cases, having more pigment in your skin reduces your risk of getting sunburned. So an organism’s life history might approximate some of the advantages of a genetic predisposition, through different mechanisms. \\\\nWith corals, the combination of the two factors is more powerful than either on its own. To test this, Palumbi’s team transplanted corals from the cooler part of the reef to the warmest pool. They left them there for three years, after which the researchers subjected them to the same set of stress tests they’d undergone three years earlier, raising the temperature to an extreme level for several days at a time. \\\\nThis time, the cool-adapted corals that had spent the last three years acclimating in warm pools did noticeably better than their cold-water clones. But the original warm-pool corals still outperformed their acclimated cousins, suggesting some older genetic advantage was also at work. \\\\nThe next step, Palumbi says, is to start trying to use these supercorals to help corals in general. To that end, his PhD student, Megan Morikawa, is establishing a coral nursery off the coast of Ofu, where she hopes to cultivate the most resilient, heat-tolerant corals they find. Like Nedimyer, they want to replenish reefs with corals, and with the genetic diversity that will allow them to survive in a range of environments. \\\\nIt’s too early to know if this will work. Palumbi is hopeful that something can be done, but aware of the challenges in scaling this kind of experiment up to a level where it can actually be effective. \\\\n\"You can’t go to a replanted reef,\" he says in his office, thousands of miles away from Ofu. \"You can go to a replanted forest, but as of now, there is no replanted reef.\" \\\\n \\\\nWhen a coral bleaches, it doesn’t necessarily die — which means some interesting things can happen after a bleaching event sweeps a reef. \\\\nA coral polyp gathers some of its food from the water current, but it gets most of its energy by harvesting the sun’s energy, using tiny algae called zooxanthellae that live inside its cells. As the water heats up, those little algae start to produce chemicals that irritate the coral cells. As these so-called \"free radicals\" build up, they start to damage the cell until the coral polyp gets so agitated it expels most or all of its zooxanthellae. \\\\nFrom then, the coral polyp is essentially on its own. It loses the pigment it gets from its symbiont algae, turning pale white, and loses the energy it gets from photosynthesis. Without that energy, the coral feeds on its reserves and strains what food it can get from the water column. It stops growing and is at risk of eventually starving to death. \\\\nIf the temperature drops again, the polyp can take up new zooxanthellae from the water and keep growing as before. But the longer the coral stays bleached, the less likely it will be able to recover. \\\\nHowever, there is a secondary effect to all this bleaching and unbleaching, which Palumbi and others have seized on as a possible source of hope. After a coral has bleached once, the next time it is subjected to abnormally high temperatures, it is much less likely to succumb. \\\\nIn the same El Niño season that wiped out Florida’s corals, the reefs around the tiny island nation of Palau bleached extensively. Today, nearly 10 years later, they have almost completely recovered, Palumbi says. In fact, at this point most reefs in the world have bleached, he says. And a good number of them have recovered. \\\\nSo corals are resilient, maybe more than we thought, and can recover from near-fatal events. But how fast can they keep up? In all their history — and at 400 million years, it’s a long one — the organisms have never experienced a rate of change like what they are subjected to today. \\\\nWhat’s more, a coral’s vulnerability to and recovery from bleaching have a lot to do with the presence of other stressors, Palumbi points out. With pollution, habitat destruction, overfishing, sedimentation, and so on, what would be a tolerable amount of climate change can become an intolerable amount. \\\\nIn this sense, Ofu is a lucky place to be a coral. Sure, the corals living in the sheltered lagoons of the remote island may have to put up with 95 degrees F — but they don’t have to deal with many humans. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nCorals can adapt and acclimate to higher temperatures — but only to a point. Even Palumbi’s supercorals, subjected to monstrously high temperatures in the stress tanks, have a limit. Eventually, given enough global warming, the world’s reefs will find their limits, too. \\\\n\"I can’t do everything,\" Palumbi admits. \"But if I can just help keep the ocean alive long enough for us to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels, we can make it.\" \\\\nThis summer, Palumbi brought 80 corals back from Ofu, small fragments from the different genotypes and environments he was hoping to test in the lab. Then all but two of the corals died when he got them to the lab, and they took their heat-resisting secrets with them. Palumbi will have to go back to the reef and start over. But he’s determined to find the corals of the world that possess the superpower to resist higher ocean temperatures, and protect them. \\\\n\"Saving the ocean for the next 85 years — that’s a pretty good job,\" he says. \"I just need to show people that it is worth it.\" \\\\nPart 3 \\\\nEvolution \\\\nThe Australian Institute of Marine Sciences stands alone at the tip of Queensland’s Cape Cleveland and looks out over the Coral Sea, toward the Great Barrier Reef. \\\\nInside sits an array of temperature- and pH-controlled tanks, sediment pumps, and stacks of high-octane computers. With all that tech, AIMS, a federally funded research center, can feel a little like NASA, if NASA were dropped in the middle of Australia and had its laser-assisted focus retrained on the oceans. High-security access badges: Check. Brilliant, high-powered scientists: Check. Evocative acronyms: So many checks. \\\\nThe blocky brick building I come to at the end of 50 km of wallaby-strewn highway is an unassuming advertisement for the pie-in-the-sky projects unfolding inside. And so, with not a little cognitive dissonance, I sign my name on a standard-issue clipboard, and head to the world’s first Sea Simulator — the SeaSim, for short. \\\\nThe 10,000-square-foot facility was built with the help of a $27 million grant from the Australian government (that’s $37 million in AUD) and the ambition to do the kinds of long-running, multi-variable experiments never before possible in run-of-the-mill marine biology labs. \\\\nThe sprawling building contains an upper story with a double row of sealed rooms, each controlled by a monitor panel outside. In some, heavy-duty pumps suspend dredge sediment in tanks lit a deep dance-club blue; others hold aquariums full of crown-of-thorns starfish, nightmarish, spiny creatures whose unchecked appetites have decimated whole swaths of reef. \\\\nBut downstairs, I find what I came for: an enormous, open-plan room that will hold the nine tanks of Madeleine van Oppen’s time machine. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nIn February of this year, Madeleine van Oppen and her colleague Ruth Gates of the University of Hawaii published a paper suggesting that we start researching whether it’s possible for humans to help corals evolve to survive in a climate-changed world. \\\\nThey called it \"assisted evolution,\" and it was a new approach to the same old problem: Corals already possess some innate resilience, but they cannot evolve fast enough to keep up with the accelerating pace of climate change. So let’s just make them evolve faster. \\\\nWith a grant from the Paul-Allen-funded Ocean Challenge prize, covering a five-year-long research project split between AIMS and the University of Hawaii, van Oppen and company set out to see if that’s even possible. If they could breed new generations of corals that outperformed their parents, maybe they could identify the secret to coral resilience, be it genetic, microbial, or something else altogether. \\\\nAnd for that, they need corals. A lot of them. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAIMS staff unload samples of coral and sand from the Great Barrier Reef, to be used in SeaSim experiments. \\\\n \\\\nThe boat comes in in the afternoon. Van Oppen drives me down to the port, where researchers with a heavy crane are lifting pallets of stacked plastic bins from the deck of the dive boat into the back of a truck. It’s sunny, so they work fast — these corals have come from Davies Reef, a nearby patch of the Great Barrier, and they are likely feeling the heat. \\\\nAs he sloshes excess seawater out of the bins, research manager Neal Cantin explains to me what they’ve brought back: entire tubs of sand and sediment, heaps of worn-down and overgrown old coral skeletons (or \"live rock\"), some algae and sponges for a different experiment, and, of course, about 80 coral colonies for van Oppen’s experiment. \\\\nThe corals are the main event, but the sand and sundry are important, too. With all these ingredients — and the ambient microbial communities they host — the researchers can create a rough copy of the reef the corals just left. Then, using data from a weather tower right over Davies Reef, they can adjust the water temperature throughout the day to match natural conditions as closely as possible. \\\\nI hitch a ride back to the SeaSim with a couple of tubs of coral and live rock. There, in the largest chamber of the Sea Simulator, Cantin and a graduate student are arranging the corals in three long tanks, flushed with seawater and lit with full-spectrum LEDs that mimic sunshine. These tanks will serve as an indoor ocean to these corals for the next five years, or longer. \\\\nEventually, there will be nine tanks in the enormous, hangar-like room, grouped by threes: One trio will be treated with water heated and cooled to match the real-time temperature data from Davies Reef. The pH levels will match normal variations the reef might experience over the course of an average day, becoming more acidic at night, in the absence of photosynthesis. The second set will have its water heated and soured to match the ocean conditions we are predicted to experience by midcentury. The third will experience the most extreme conditions, with temperatures and acidity mimicking what we might see by 2100 if climate change is left unchecked. \\\\nAll the corals will spend a few months acclimating to these new normals. The scientists expect many of them will become stressed, even bleach — but that’s only the beginning. What they really want to find out is how the kids do. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nThe idea that humans might \"assist evolution,\" while it sounds wacky, is not truly anything that new. We’ve been changing the evolution of plenty of species, intentionally and otherwise, for about as long as we’ve been living in social groups. We \"assist\" evolution when we breed animals to perpetuate traits — milk production, for example, or docile behavior — that we find beneficial. We also can be said to assist evolution when we build environments, like cities, where certain animals, like pigeons, can find an ecological niche that never existed in the wild. \\\\nAnd we’re already applying selective pressures to coral. From global warming to ocean acidification, we’re changing the natural environment such that some corals are better adapted to survive than others. But evolution, while it’s happening, is not happening fast enough — and those selective pressures of ocean acidification and ocean warming run the risk of selecting reefs right out of existence. \\\\nGenetic selection is the most familiar kind of evolution, but the process of accumulating genetic adaptations is typically a slow one, reliant on chance mutations that occur in the right place at the right time. And corals only spawn once a year and grow slowly — which means there aren’t many chances to get things right. \\\\nSo van Oppen’s group is looking to find the helpful mutations first, and maybe eventually find a way to spread them among wild corals. She is also looking for \"epigenetic\" changes in the corals, which is a catch-all term for the things that act on the genome, but are not a part of it. \\\\nFor example, certain molecules may be attached to parts of an organism’s DNA, controlling whether a certain gene is turned on or off. If the gene is turned off, the cell won’t produce the protein that the gene codes for. In this way, an individual of a species may possess all the genes necessary to produce some trait without actually expressing the trait — all depending on its epigenetics. \\\\nThese epigenetic markers have, in some cases, seemed to be heritable from a parent organism to its offspring. Van Oppen believes that epigenetics may hold the key to jump-starting corals’ non-traditional evolution in the face of warmer, more acidic waters. And if we can get a head-start on climate change by seeing what these changes might look like, maybe we can help nudge today’s reefs in the direction they need to go. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\nBaby Pocillopora growing up in the SeaSim tanks. \\\\n \\\\nPocillopora — \"poss-ill-uh-pour-uh\" — acuta are pale, knobby lumps of coral, each about the size and shape of a head of cauliflower. They are fast-growing and branching, which makes them important reef building species, not unlike the more common Acropora. \\\\nBut Pocillopora do one weird thing differently from most other corals. Instead of spawning just once a year, Pocillopora can reproduce asexually, releasing fully formed clonal larvae every month or so. In van Oppen’s lab, these larvae will settle onto little ceramic discs prepared by researchers and start to grow. Some of the baby corals will be moved around — the hot future larvae back to cold present-day tanks, and vice versa — to see how they do. Then this whole step will be repeated one more time, with a third generation of corals. \\\\nIf the second- and third-generations of corals born and raised in future ocean conditions seem robust, that may tell us about how reefs could change in real-time. But even if corals are capable of keeping up with stressfully high temperatures and acidity, they still may change in ways that will fundamentally change the reefs themselves. The corals may not grow as fast, and they may reproduce differently. Larvae might have more trouble developing, or might develop differently. \\\\nAnd if the third generation of Pocillopora do end up stronger than their forebearers? The next step could be one of sci-fi proportions: to take these speed-evolved corals out onto the reef. These ultra resilient corals could potentially be used to restore damaged reefs, while providing a set of genes that could pass some of that accelerated resilience on to the next generation. \\\\nThe other experiments van Oppen’s team will be running have some similarly stunning implications. For example, if the scientists experimentally evolve a strain of symbiotic zooxanthellae that makes its coral host more resistant to bleaching, they could conceivably grow huge tanks of it, to dump on reefs during especially hot spells. \\\\nTo be clear, these are all pretty long shots for a lot of different reasons. But even if they’re shown to work, is it a good idea? \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n\"It’s not up to us in the end whether it will actually be implemented,\" Madeleine van Oppen told me, before I could even ask. Her experiments are such an early step on the road to large-scale reef engineering that she only spends a few minutes talking about the possibility. For van Oppen, the important thing is that we at least start asking the right questions. Answering them is a whole different research project. \\\\nWhat we definitely don’t want to do, she says, is to introduce new problems into a system we’ve already thrown out of whack. \"We are very good at messing things up, changing this planet tremendously,\" van Oppen says. \"We’re also very innovative and intelligent, I suppose. We’ve come up with lots of good solutions.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nThe math on staying below 2°C of global warming looks increasingly brutal\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nOne thing is sure: We’ll have to put the brakes on climate change eventually, if we want to stave off disaster — on this point, everyone agrees. But even if we phase out greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 or 20 years, the atmosphere and oceans will continue to warm for years after — so we need to be prepared to deal with that. \\\\nIn a certain light, this crisis is nothing new for humans, says van Oppen: \"We pollute the environment and then we clean it up. We develop bacteria that can digest hydrocarbons when there’s been an oil spill. It’s no different from other things where we clean up after the mess we have made. We do that all the time. Unfortunately, that’s how humans are.\" \\\\nI’m starting to get the sense that if scientists, governments, and nonprofits can figure out how to engineer a better coral reef, it will be because, in the end, it’s easier to change nature itself than it is to change human nature. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nThe Great Barrier Reef is a bucket list item if there ever was one. It’s the largest living barrier reef in the world, roughly the size of Italy, and one of the only biological objects visible from space. \\\\nHome to some of the strangest (and most venomous) creatures in the ocean, the GBR is a poster child of what we stand to lose as the oceans warm. I had always wanted to see it for myself. \\\\nSo one morning, on an ocean as flat and blue as a swimming pool, empty of other boats all the way to the cloud-strewn horizon, I hold a mask and regulator to my face and step into the water. \\\\nUnderneath, huge mounds of coral rise 30 feet from the seafloor almost to the surface. I am surprised to find that these seamounts — called \"bommies\" in Aussie — are veritable catalogue advertisements of reef health and diversity. I see all kinds of Acropora — big, branching thickets of elkhorn, wide terraces of tabletop coral — all colored a healthy deep orange or yellow. Pocillopora sit on the tops of lower mounts like frilly heads of lettuce. I see enormous brain corals and tiny, fine-fingered soft corals that swayed in the current. \\\\nAll around these pillars and buttresses, life swarms and flashes like static electricity: angelfish, damselfish, clownfish, a massive school of yellow-finned jacks winding between two bommies. There are skates bearing blue spots the size of silver dollars and parrotfish in all the colors of an ’80s aerobics instructor’s leotard. Electric-blue seastars stand out like asterisks on the sand, where giant clams flick their purple lips as I swim over. \\\\nIf there is trouble on the Great Barrier Reef — and, by all accounts, there is — I can’t see a sign of it from behind my mask. In all its wild wholeness, this little patch of Edenic reef seems to stand both for what has been lost everywhere else, and what we stand to save. \\\\nBut as I haul myself back out of the water — suddenly transformed back into a clumsy two-legged creature wearing 60 pounds of dive equipment and a fogged mask in front of my face — I feel both smaller and bigger than before. No matter how much I wanted to believe it while I was underwater, I knew that the idea of a pristine reef is an illusion. There are no virgin reefs to \"preserve.\" Any reef, any ecosystem, no matter how lovely, is in the process of being affected by the 7 billion (and counting) people of the world. \\\\nBut that’s the way it’s always been. The reef is always changing: It is fed by currents and smashed by storms, and subject to the whims of the animals moving in waves over it. Flux is a fact of nature, and humans are now a part of that. If we want to start setting right some of the balances we’ve upset, coral reefs are as good a symbol as any of where our real work begins — at the intersection between the world and ourselves. \\\\nThis story was supported by a grant from the Earth Journalism Network. \\\\nGrist is a nonprofit news site that uses humor to shine a light on big green issues.

Guns kill more people than AIDS, war, illegal drug overdoses, and terrorism combined. And when you look back over the entire history of the country — stretching back to the Revolutionary War — you learn that guns have killed more Americans than all the wars we've fought in combined.  \\\\nAbout 1.17 million people have died in combat since the founding of the US. About 1.49 million have died of a gunshot since Bobby Kennedy was shot and killed in 1968, which is about as far back as we could find good data. \\\\nThe two World Wars and the Civil War were devastating. More than 400,000 Americans died in World War II. But in the past 47 years, guns have killed more people than every war going back to the Revolutionary War, when battles were fought with muskets and the Second Amendment didn't exist. \\\\nDuring the Obama administration alone, guns have killed more Americans than World War I did. \\\\n     \\\\n \\\\nMost of these gun deaths are suicides, followed by homicides and then accidental deaths. There are about 11,000 firearm homicides each year, which is a big chunk of the approximately 33,000 annual gun deaths in the US. \\\\nLearn more about gun violence in America here. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLearn more \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPulse gay nightclub shooting in Orlando: the deadliest in US history \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nObama is right.



       "   \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nstory,interview \\\\n \\\\nYou might be tempted to bail on Amazon Prime's new Mozart in the Jungle, which launched last Tuesday on the streaming service. The show is about a young oboist trying to break into a New York orchestra, and for much of the first season, the series' reach seems to exceed its grasp. \\\\nThe season's first half is filled with good moments, but also doesn't seem at all to know what it's trying to do. The story is all over the place, the characters don't quite register, and the tone vacillates wildly between cringe comedy and bittersweet melodrama. \\\\nYet this show is unquestionably worth sticking with, particularly since with just 10 half-hour episodes, it speeds right by. Around episode six — wherein Gael Garcia Bernal's conductor Rodrigo takes his orchestra out into a vacant lot for a rehearsal — the show mostly snaps into place, and the back half of the season gathers so much momentum rolling toward its climax that it becomes hard to resist. By the final three episodes (essentially a three-part season finale), the show has figured out what it wants to do, and it's not hard to hope season two will hit the ground running. \\\\nHere are five great reasons to stick with this one to the very end. (And if you're curious, you can watch it here.) \\\\n1) Episode seven\\\\n \\\\nDirected by co-creator Roman Coppola (you can also read my interview with him) and written by Adam Brooks and Kate Gerson, \"You Go to My Head\" is one of the best TV episodes of the year. It's a swoony, fizzy break from the rest of the season's action, as the characters attend a massive fundraiser for the orchestra and find themselves sliding so easily into the lifestyles of the idle rich. \\\\nI'm a noted sucker for episodes that break up the surrounding narrative to tell little one-and-done stories that are nothing else like the other episodes around them. But even taking that into mind, \"You Go to My Head\" is a quiet stunner. The show has been trying to make some weird combination of magical realism and psychological depth work all season long, but it's here — particularly in the material involving Rodrigo — that the technique snaps into place. \\\\nYou could almost watch this one disconnected from the rest of the season, but it's all the stronger for checking it out in context. And the closing shot is a beauty. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLola Kirke and Gael Garcia Bernal star in Mozart in the Jungle. (Amazon Studios) \\\\n \\\\n2) It talks about class \\\\nThe early portions of the season are a bit clunky in their attempts to address the disparity between the rich and the lower classes in Manhattan, essentially using brute force to make these points clear. But the longer the season goes on, the more the show digs into how much more disastrous everything is for its protagonist Hailey (Lola Kirke), who desperately wants to follow her art to the ends of the earth but rarely has the money to make that happen. \\\\nIt's easier for rich people to fail, Mozart in the Jungle argues, something that's been borne out by real life time and again. But though TV is fond of seeing people fail, it rarely digs into how economically disastrous that can be for someone like Hailey. She might have enough money to scrape by in New York, but she's very much working under a ticking clock that could run out at any time. \\\\n3) It talks about art — and who it's for \\\\nClassical music, of course, isn't the most natural setting for a TV show, because it's not a setting infused with natural, life-and-death conflict. But that means the series tackles some knotty artistic questions over the course of the first season. \\\\nChiefly, the show is concerned with who art is for. Is it for the artists performing? The audience listening? Is it for the rich people who support the orchestra financially? Or the people of the city of New York, whose name is in the symphony's moniker? Savvy, business-minded symphony director Gloria (Bernadette Peters) buys off cops with season tickets to the orchestra, but of what true value are such things? \\\\nWe've decided classical music is of more inherent value than most other forms of music, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. As Rodrigo says in that seventh episode, he can like The Police just as much as any classical composer. Music is music, and if it works, it's important to us. The rarefied world of Mozart is only rarefied because we've decided it should be. It doesn't necessarily have to be. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n4) Betty \\\\nMozart in the Jungle has great characters at every level, but perhaps my favorite was the supporting character of Betty (Debra Monk). As the first-chair oboist in the orchestra, she has the job Hailey wants. And she's acutely aware of that, viewing Hailey with suspicion, bitterness, and even outright contempt. (She frequently suggests Hailey has only seen the success she has because she's sleeping with Rodrigo.) \\\\nBetty is a spin on a character we've seen before — the frustrated woman in late middle age who tells it like it is — but the show manages to find a way to make her sympathetic while never robbing her of her harsher edges. I mentioned above that this show deals well with failure, and there's real tension in the story of Betty taking on Hailey as a student. She clearly doesn't think Hailey has what it takes, and the question remains of whether that's her honest, professional opinion (and, thus, probably accurate) or driven by the grudge she bears against the younger woman. It's fascinating stuff. \\\\n5) In its best moments, it's sorta like Robert Altman's Slings and Arrows\\\\n \\\\nOf the two things I mention here, you're likelier to have heard of Robert Altman, the acclaimed director whose films used massive ensembles of actors to create giant tapestries his camera could drift through. Improvised dialogue and overlapping conversations added to the sense that we weren't watching a movie but, instead, touring some sort of community we normally wouldn't be privy to. His best films, like M*A*S*H, Nashville, and Short Cuts, are American classics. \\\\nMozart in the Jungle captures at least a little of this feel in the scenes when the orchestra is gathered, and the camera cuts between various small conversations held among its members. It couldn't have been easy (or inexpensive) to find this many solid actors to fill that orchestra, but it pays off in these moments, which are unlike anything else on TV for their sense of community building, a sense that pays off tenfold in the finale. \\\\nBut there's also more than a little of Slings and Arrows in here. That Canadian series explored the inner workings of a Shakespeare festival and the tortured genius recruited to run it. It's a hyper-obscure series on these shores, but it's one of the best shows of all time and well worth seeking out. The overlap with Mozart here — behind the scenes of a normally cloistered artistic endeavor — is a little more obvious, but I'm paying Mozart high praise when I say that it eventually builds to a point where it at least deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the earlier show. It's not to that level yet, but by the end of season one, it seems like it might have the stuff to get there someday. \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola's career has visited nearly every other corner of the filmmaking industry, so it's only appropriate that he would end up making a television show eventually. He's perhaps best known for his terrific 2001 film CQ, which took viewers inside the world of '60s and '70s European sci-fi films, and for his work writing films with director Wes Anderson, including The Darjeeling Limited and Moonrise Kingdom (for which he was nominated for an Oscar). \\\\nNow, Coppola has entered into another filmmaking super-team to create and produce Amazon's new series Mozart in the Jungle, set amid the personnel of a modern New York Orchestra. (You can watch it here.) He co-created the series, loosely based on Blair Tindall's memoir of her classical music career in the '80s, with Jason Schwartzman (incidentally, his cousin) and theatrical genius Alex Timbers. Filmmaker Paul Weitz served as its head director. Now, in the wake of Mozart's launch, Vox talked to him about the process of coming to TV, what it's like to work with Anderson, and why he likes to explore worlds that are so foreign to audiences and himself. \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: How did you go about turning this book into a TV series? Adapting a book into a film is pretty straightforward, but a TV series is such a different creature. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: It's very different. In fact, this book is not a novel. It's a memoir. So it's basically the account of a young woman getting exposed to the world of classical music and her experience. It really was just a jumping off point. I know people say that a lot, but it's pretty sincere here. We loved this idea of pulling back the curtain, looking inside, how does it work, what happens, how do these people relate to each other. \\\\nBut it was set in the '80s. It was obviously a different time. The rise of AIDS and drugs and that type of thing, it was all distinctive to that time. We felt we wanted our piece to be much more contemporary. So we didn't really take much. There are a few episodes and a few funny situations that we borrowed. In the pilot episode, when the Saffron Burrows character says different instrumentalists' love-making style mimics their instrument to some degree, that was from her book. \\\\nSo there were some fun details that we took. But we wanted to tell a story about the characters that she didn't really portray in her book. So we made a lot of stuff up. \\\\nI should say the premise of a young oboist, which is what Blair Tindall was, coming in from a smaller town and being so excellent in her environment and then seeing if she had what it took to join the best of the best, some of those overall ideas were relevant, but not really the direct situations. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: This is not a world that's been in TV series a lot. What were the challenges of making a show about an orchestra? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: One of the obvious challenges is to portray an orchestra, you need those 50, 60 people, and that's pretty challenging. The space to do that and to show that level of skill. So that was something that was definitely a production challenge. The show is set in Manhattan and there's this notion of the high and the low. Manhattan is, of course, a city which has very wealthy people, then has immigrants and every kind of contrast. So that was something that we wanted to portray. \\\\nThe show is set in Manhattan and there's this notion of the high and the low. \\\\nWe portray a rather lavish lifestyle, the people who are in this world, and the parties and soirees, and the extras, and the wardrobe. Just on a practical level, to portray that kind of stuff is expensive and difficult, and it's not just run and gun in the city [shooting on the go, often with handheld cameras]. So that was an aspect of the reality of our show that we wanted to portray all that stuff. So that comes to mind. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: What were some other visual elements you wanted to pull out of this world, in the directorial style and the look of the show? Because music is such an auditory experience, but television is a visual one. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: We are literally and metaphorically pulling the curtain back on an orchestra and looking on the inside. So often, people who are interested in classical music, you see it, and it's such a distant thing. You sit in your seat. The players are 50 feet away, and you don't really enter into it. \\\\nOur camera's moving among these people. Seeing how, for example, an oboist has to carve their reed and the more central aspects of it and the more banal aspects too. So that was important to us, to penetrate through. \\\\nThere's some images in the pilot, there's these guys in tuxedos, and they take their tuxedo off and put their sweatpants on, and they're just regular guys. So that kind of visual contrast appealed to us, to show the high and the low in that manner. And these are working folks who have to deal with their mortgage and have a couple of other gigs that they have to do, even though they're playing the most outstanding, rarefied music. It's just regular life. They have a wedding gig or some other thing right around the corner. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola (right) is joined by fellow Mozart in the Jungle producers Paul Weitz (left) and Jason Schwartzman at the show's premiere. (Brian Ach/Getty Images) \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: This show has a lot of creative minds working behind the scenes. Briefly, what do you think all of you brought to this process that turned it into the show it is? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: Jason [Schwartzman] is the one who found this book, and he's the one who said, \"Hey, wouldn't this be a great show.\" And when I saw it, it was, like, \"Oh, my God, yes, this would be a great show.\" It's so rich. And so unusual, but yet familiar, because after all, any workplace, there's some charismatic boss and some younger guy who's coming in, and this dysfunctional family aspect of what an orchestra is in a way. These are people who work together year after year after year. We had some great stories that we picked up in our research where people who worked in an orchestra 20 years and they haven't spoken in 15 years, due to some personal thing. \\\\nThen Alex Timbers, who was the other key collaborator, he cracked the nut of the script. We knew, as I mentioned, that we didn't want to base it strictly on this memoir. Alex Timbers is very well regarded in the New York theatre scene. And he was very savvy about, \"Oh, the donors would have this type of fundraiser,\" and \"Musicians always hang out at this bar.\" He had a lot of direct insights into the New York music scene. \\\\nPaul Weitz, who was the other main collaborator, as the director of the pilot and two of the other episodes, he chose predominantly the actors. He's the one that really gathered our cast, with Gael [Garcia Bernal] and Malcolm [McDowell], whom he knew from before, and Saffron, and Lola [Kirke]. He really gets so much of the credit for finding the cast. We all participated, but he led the charge. \\\\nWe have a lot of people with striking ideas. I was maybe just someone who helped them try to find a balance somehow and tried to help guide it so that it had a fluid quality. \\\\nThere's these guys in tuxedos, and they take their tuxedos off and put their sweatpants on, and they're just regular guys \\\\nAlthough, having said that, as you're watching the show, we all really embraced that it's kind of a show that has a lot of different personalities to it. It's not just one thing. It has a bit of a blend of humor and drama and trashy, outrageous, sexy misconduct. Even though I was involved with keeping it of apiece, we all wanted, myself included, a bit of a diverse feeling, so when you see this show, it's not just that one thing. I feel like it has a nice sense of diverseness and a little bit of chaos, too. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: How involved were all of you in the day to day operations of the show? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: We were quite involved. One of us was there every day on the set. I had a little stretch for two or three weeks where I was not around, and then Jason had some press obligations. But one of us was always there, and then usually two of us, between Jason, myself, and Paul. And Paul directed the two episodes from the series, and I directed one. So we had a lot of hands-on participation. And Jason appears in a cameo. \\\\nInitially, when we got the show going, we thought, \"Oh, well, what do we know about television? We should surround ourselves with people who can help lead this for us.\" But then we realized, hey, this is our show, and we really want it to be a reflection of what we want to see. So we just jumped in there and got very involved as it unfolded. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: I read this really fascinating piece that talked about how many people who started in film are going to TV, and TV, in a lot of ways, has become the new independent or even mid-budget film. Have you had that sense that TV is a world that is a little more welcoming of this kind of thing at this point in time? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: Definitely, there is some exciting energy that's happening in the world of television. When I was a kid, you watched TV, except for some exceptional shows, and it was usually pretty junky. You'd never see a prominent film actor in a television role. That would be pretty unusual. But now, so many very talented actors are. There's not a stigma. There's a lot of compliments that go to the fine writing that's happening. So for sure there's a renaissance happening in television. \\\\nDefinitely, there is some exciting energy that's happening in the world of television. \\\\nTo me, my career, personally, I've done a lot of different things. I've worked in commercials, so that's a 30-second spot or a 15-second spot. I've done a lot of music videos that are three minutes, and some shorts that are 10 minutes. I've made features, as a writer, director, producer. And now I'm working in television, which is a five-hour expansive work. So I personally am attracted to television because it's in this exciting place. But I'm just attracted to everything involved with media and film. I respond to things that pique my curiosity, and getting involved in television was something that I couldn't turn down. \\\\nBut there's a charge. Things are happening. It's very immediate. We were writing scenes that day or the day before we were going to shoot them, due to some need. Maybe there was an actor's availability, or a location change, or whatever it may be, or just a flaw in the script. And we were writing lines, and they were literally shooting it that day or the next day. And that's incredible, when you think that you work on a feature, and you're writing some dialogue, and they probably won't even be filming that dialogue for eight months, if you're really, incredibly lucky. Most likely, it's two or three years, 10 years, or never. So that sense of immediacy, making something and having it produced as you're making it, is really thrilling. \\\\nIt's very exciting, and I'm glad to be part of it. There's always wonderful movies. We always lament, \"Oh, movies, it's such a tough time.\" It's always tough, and it's always been tough. But it is particularly tough right now. These sort of lower, mid-range budget films that in the past were quite prominent have really sort of evaporated at this particular moment. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: Do you have anything you attribute this to? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: I've been around movies so long, you'd feel like I'd have some special insight, but I just don't know. It's hard to really say. There was that sort of boom when the video market was strong. It created a lift in that there was this assured way to make back money. If you had a movie that even if it didn't perform theatrically, there was that cushion of video and pay TV outlets. And now the DVD market's dried up, and downloads and streaming hasn't quite risen up to the height of the other one. That's probably part of it. But it's not really my expertise. \\\\nIt's a very tough business, and costs for marketing, for some reason, just got higher and higher and higher. So between those costs, to make people aware of your thing, and then not having that cushion of a video release just seems like it's created a hole there. It's very easy to lose a lot of millions of dollars making a movie, and that discourages people. They tend to do more sure things. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: Amazon is really trying to build its brand. It seems to be taking chances on stuff that not a lot of other people would be doing. What was the process of working with Amazon like, and what do you think it brought to this production? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: I have to say I was very impressed. We had a great experience. We wrote this pilot, and they read it, and there was just something about the pilot and the world it portrayed that they just immediately said, \"We want to do this show.\" There was no discussion. Not \"Oh, this could be something if we do this or do that.\" It clicked for them. From that point forward, we were off and running, making our pilot. \\\\nThey have a system by which they present a pilot, and there's some kind of evaluation based on how many people look at it and view it and rate it. And once it crossed that threshold, they said, \"Hey, let's make the show.\" They were very great. Very supportive. They relied on us. We had myself and Jason and Paul and Alex Timbers, a group of people that had come through for them and had come through on other things. And I think they just felt like, \"Hey, let's back the team.\" That's always the sense we had. \\\\nThere were issues where maybe our scripts were a little bit late. We did a scene later where one of the characters disappears, and we wanted to have a scene where they travel to find them, which was not really in the budget. But they made sure to accommodate us. They were very supportive, and now, as they're promoting it, we're starting to see a lot of posters, and there's a real verve to get it out there. It was a very positive experience. All the criticism was constructive. \\\\nI sound like I'm totally doing a fluff piece, but I'm being very sincere. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMalcolm McDowell plays the composer's former conductor. (Amazon Studios) \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: What do you see as the advantage of having all of the episodes there to consume on launch day? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: It's interesting. People seem to really enjoy that, as I do, to really dig in and see something. It's like a novel. You want to keep pushing through it. There is something about our nature that when you're in the bosom of a story, you just want to keep it going. It makes sense. It's just our human nature. \\\\nOn a practical level, originally, when we conceived the show, Jason and I, we thought we'd love to have a sort of epic quality with a lot of characters interlaced. But when you thought of television, you thought of a show, and each show was a bit more standalone. Maybe on this show, we follow this character, that show, we follow that character. But working with Amazon and also with what's just happened in television, we became more cognizant of this notion that people would binge watch it. \\\\nWe realized, to our advantage, that a lot of times in a show, if people haven't seen something in a week or two, you have to recap everything. \"Hey, that's the guy that last week stole my money!\" You have to set some context. Here, there's some really nice liberty to say, \"You know what? People just watched the other episodes. Let's just move forward.\" Things didn't have to repeat or echo, and we continued on. \\\\nI wouldn't want to overstate this, but in a way, there's three movies in the season. There's these little groups. The last three episodes all kind of work together. So there are these neat little groups of episodes that come together to make one big more longer-form piece. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: You've done a lot of work with Wes Anderson. He has such a distinctive visual style. What's his writing process like? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: It's very distinctive. It's unlike any other person I've worked with. He thinks in the moment of the scene. There's words that come to his mind, or memories, or a recollection of some funny thing or situation, that forms a kernel of some dialogue or some description. And then it kind of slowly goes forward from there. There's basically zero conversation about themes or structure or meaning or what should we say or how should we say this. It's a very immediate, sensual thing. The sound of a word or what something suggests, and then a character will say something, and it's, like, \"Oh, they said that. So what happens next?\" \\\\nIt all grows in this kind of very natural way. There's no scheming, or, \"Oh, we should do this,\" or anything like that. It all just flows out. We've talked about it a lot in interviews or places where people will ask, and Wes will say something to the effect of, that writing is just telling a story out loud, and daydreaming a story out loud. And by doing it with another person, like someone like myself, or with Jason, it's just more companionship and company there. Rather than being alone in a room by yourself, you're with another person. \\\\nThe way the words are placed on the page and the way a sentence is structured is something [Wes Anderson] puts a lot of energy into. \\\\nSo there is a social part of it where when we write, we chat about our days or have a meal. It's very unique. \\\\nI could go on and on, but one more thing that's interesting is when he's writing and we're doing something together, the way the words are placed on the page and the way a sentence is structured is something he puts a lot of energy into. Some other writers, you just kind of say it. You just express it. Because you're making a movie anyway. Why bother with the writing? But he's rather meticulous and puts a lot of care into the way things are described. Which is just his manner, and it comes across in his movies. But it's something he takes pleasure in, making a sentence work right. So when he's writing, and I'm writing with him, there's an emphasis on the words and the way they're laid out and the way they're structured. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: This collaborative process sounds very similar to how a TV show is written. We have an image in our head of writers being lone, tortured geniuses. But what do you enjoy about that process of collaboration? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: It all depends on the person, of course, but I worked with Jason, and we wrote one of the episodes on the show ourselves. We rewrote a lot of stuff, and suggested things that were written with the group of writers. But on the script we wrote together, we stayed up all night, and we hung out. Sometimes, when there's a lot of pressure to deliver something, as was the case on a TV show, you don't have a lot of time. You're up all night. You get delirious. And Jason, being my cousin, who I love so deeply, it's fun. \\\\nIn our case, Jason tends to have really wild ideas, and he's so witty and funny. And sometimes, they push the outer limits of what might be appropriate, and I am a bit of a tempering force. I'll go, \"Okay, we can do this, but maybe we should reconsider that.\" So we're a good team together. \\\\nBut the sensation, to answer your question, is one of staying up all night to do your homework, and it's a blast, especially when you've gotten through it, and you've accomplished it. It's just a fun sensation. You've pushed yourself, and the fact that you know that whatever you do will be filmed within two or three weeks time, that's a real motivator. You can't say, \"Oh, we'll rehearse and figure it out.\" You're on. And it's fun. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTodd VanDerWerff: It seems to me like a thing you really enjoy doing, in this and in a movie like CQ, is going into another world that's a little different, a little foreign to us, and making it a world we can explore along with the characters. What about that type of story appeals to you? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRoman Coppola: I love sensations and environments and music is part of that, and the feeling you get when you're immersed in the music. I love architecture, and visiting places that you enter in. It's just one of my things that I'm drawn to. \\\\nThere's also sort of an element of exploration. When I did CQ, I became aware of those kind of '60s/'70s sci-fi movies that were being made in France and Italy, and then I was a fan of the French New Wave films, those art films and so on. It's just a way for me to sort of explore that world and pretend I was there. You recreate it around you. It's just a place you're going to visit in the experience of making the film, with the hope that the viewer will enjoy that trip. The movies that I particularly like are movies that are less hardcore story-driven but more like a world that you enter into and experience in a more sensual way, through the characters, through the settings, through the music, through the world. It's just something I'm drawn to. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n

       "   \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl was 12 years old when she told her best friend that she has HIV. She’s had the virus since birth — her mother unknowingly contracted it from her father, who eventually left the family. \\\\n\"I didn’t really fully understand what exactly I was telling my friend at the time,\" Rawl, now a college student, told me. \"I didn’t really understand what having this disease could mean until after I started getting the reactions from other people.\" \\\\nThose reactions were devastating. Paige’s admission quickly spread through her Indianapolis middle school. Rawl’s schoolmates — even her friends — responded by mocking and ostracizing her. They refused to use the water fountain after her — afraid they’d get the disease, too. She was beat up and called names. Rawl went to the school counselor for help. Her advice to Rawl? Tell her friends that she didn’t have HIV after all. \\\\nMore than one in three Americans holds at least one wrong belief about HIV transmissions \\\\n\"For me, that was bad,\" Rawl said. \"This was someone I thought I could go to.\" \\\\nThe last straw came when a soccer coach at the school asked Rawl about her condition in front of the entire team. \\\\n\"My mom confronted my coach,\" Rawl said. \"The coach made a joke to my mom that the team could use my HIV status to our advantage, because the players on the other team would be scared to touch me, and I could score goals.\" \\\\nRawl withdrew from school and was homeschooled until college. \\\\n\"It was really hard, because I was so involved. I did show choir, soccer, and all that,\" she said. \"So homeschooling for me was really hard, but it was something I had to do because the bullying got so bad.\" \\\\nMisconceptions about HIV remain \\\\nRawl’s experiences aren’t unique — many of the 1.2 million people living with HIV in America face similar cruelty and misunderstanding from their communities. I wanted to learn more about their experiences, so in 2014, I contacted advocacy groups to connect with people living with the disease. I interviewed eight HIV-positive people, with a range of ages, sexual orientations, races, and backgrounds. These interviews, of course, don’t represent everyone living with HIV or AIDS. But they provide a glimpse into just how harmful the persistent misconceptions around the disease can be, even for some of the most optimistic people living with HIV. \\\\n \\\\nRead the interviews \\\\n \\\\nThere was a consistent theme in these interviews. After people were diagnosed, they quickly learned that proper medication can make the disease less deadly and more difficult to transmit. Indeed, HIV isn’t the death sentence it was in the 1980s and early 1990s. The age-adjusted death rate among people diagnosed with HIV and AIDS dropped by 93 percent between 1987 and 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A large part of that, the CDC explains, is attributable to the development of highly effective antiretroviral medication. \\\\nThe big problem for these HIV-positive people instead came through the stigma attached to the disease. Three decades after the rise of HIV terrorized the world, many misunderstandings attached to the disease remain — from misconceptions about whom it affects to confusion about how it’s actually transmitted. \\\\nMore than one in three Americans, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found, hold at least one wrong belief about HIV transmissions. About 27 percent don't know it can't be spread by sharing a drinking glass, 17 percent don't know it can't be transmitted by touching a toilet seat, and 11 percent don't know it can't be caught by swimming in a pool with someone who is HIV positive. \\\\n \\\\n\"When people see me, they’re often surprised when I tell them I have HIV,\" said Danny Harris, from Little Rock, Arkansas. \"You can tell they’re taken aback, because we still live in a state here that thinks you can get it from kissing someone or sitting on a toilet seat.\" \\\\nThese misunderstandings could affect public health \\\\nThe stigma surrounding HIV makes life more challenging for people with the disease. The people I interviewed described being afraid to tell their families about their status, and concerns about how the disease affects their friendships and romantic relationships. The stigma also poses public health risks: Advocates and researchers are concerned that these misunderstandings could cause the disease to spread further. \\\\n\"There’s issues around stigma and homophobia,\" said Amy Lansky, an HIV researcher at the CDC. \"That might deter some young men from seeking HIV prevention services and testing.\" \\\\nA 2009 survey found that one in three people living with HIV still experiences high levels of discrimination due to the disease. Worse, those reporting the highest levels of stigma also report poor access to medical care. The stigma, in other words, correlates with less prevention and care for HIV. \\\\nThe stigma also appears to make doctors wary of recommending HIV testing. In a 2011 survey, black doctors, who are more active in black communities in which HIV is more prevalent, said three of five barriers to offering routine testing for HIV are related to social stigma. Physicians said they're particularly concerned that patients may perceive a test recommendation as accusatory or judgmental. \\\\n\"Living in Arkansas, being HIV positive communicates a lot of things. It communicates that he’s gay, he’s nasty, and he’s having random sex with all kinds of different people.\" \\\\nThis problem can extend further, after someone is tested for HIV. Jimmy Walker, from Little Rock, said his doctor in Atlanta, where he lived at the time, offered little support after he was diagnosed. \\\\n\"The doctor came that morning and said he had run a full gamut of tests to see if I contracted any kinds of diseases, and he told me all of those came back fine — but my HIV test came back positive,\" Walker said. \"Then he walked out of the room and left me there.\" \\\\nSeveral of the people I interviewed also said that their doctors didn’t give them adequate information after they were diagnosed. They instead resorted to friends, peers, and the internet. For some of the subjects, talking about HIV is so stigmatized — even treated as a joke — that people can’t discuss where to get help. \\\\nTommy Luckett, from Little Rock, said she wasn’t aware of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, a federal program that helps low-income people obtain antiretroviral medication, until she chatted with a Tennessee-based friend online. \\\\n\"I felt fear, like I was going to die,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what I would be able to do, because I knew that I didn’t have the money to pay for any medication. I had already heard about how expensive the medicines were.\" \\\\nLuckett’s friend suggested that if HIV/AIDS support services exist in Tennessee, they surely exist in Arkansas as well. That led Luckett to the Ryan White Program in Arkansas, which helped pay for her treatments from then on. But without that one friend online, Luckett could have been left helpless — largely because the mere discussion of HIV can be so taboo. \\\\nAdvocates and officials work to fight the stigma \\\\nThe discrimination people with HIV face is compounded by a troubling reality: More and more young gay and bisexual men are contracting HIV. \\\\nA 2014 CDC study found that among all groups, annual HIV diagnoses between 2001 and 2011 increased the most among 13- to 24-year-old boys and men who have sex with men. Previous CDC studies also found a 22 percent increase in new annual HIV infections between 2008 and 2010 among the same group, and youth ages 13 to 24 accounted for more than one in four new HIV infections in the US in 2010. \\\\n \\\\nFor advocates, part of tackling this alarming trend is dismantling the stigma attached to HIV. \\\\nPart of that is undoing anti-gay attitudes attached to the disease, which came about because HIV is more common among gay and bisexual communities. These attitudes can make it more difficult for gay and bisexual men with the disease to get proper care. A 2011 review of the research from the National Center of HIV found gay and bisexual men can delay getting treatment because they’re uncomfortable with their sexuality and are cautious of exposing themselves to any potential discrimination from health care providers. \\\\nDanny Harris confronted these attitudes in Little Rock. \"Living in Arkansas, being HIV-positive communicates a lot of things,\" he said. \"It communicates that he’s gay, he’s nasty, and he’s having random sex with all kinds of different people.\" \\\\nAnother part of the stigma is that people only get HIV due to careless behavior and somehow deserve the disease. But Rawl has lived with HIV since birth. One of the men I interviewed was raped and contracted the disease. Many of the people I talked to were monogamous at the time they caught HIV, but their partners were either disloyal or didn’t know they were HIV-positive. \\\\nBy breaking down these barriers, advocates and officials hope to open up discussion about HIV without the stigma attached to it. That could open more people to the idea that they might have the disease and should get tested for it, which can be a major hurdle — particularly for younger populations. A 2012 CDC survey of high school students found nearly 60 percent of young people with HIV are unaware of their infection, which obviously makes them much less likely to take proper medical precautions that would make the disease less transmittable and deadly. \\\\nOther times advocates take on the idea that the disease is still as fatal as it once was, which might scare people away from talking about the disease or thinking that they could have it. Harris travels across Arkansas to help people living with HIV. At first, he struggled about whether he should come out as HIV-positive. \"After a while, I began to think it through and decided it was better that it be known,\" he said. \"I could demonstrate with my own testimony and my own life that HIV doesn’t win unless you give it the victory.\" \\\\nAdvocates and officials hope to open up discussion about HIV without the stigma attached to it \\\\nTo some degree, it seems this advocacy work has succeeded since the 1990s. The CDC’s Lansky points out that overall diagnoses and infections are down by one-third between 2001 and 2011, but most of those improvements were among injection drug users and heterosexual men and women. She said it’s now a matter of doubling down on efforts and building on progress made over the past few decades, particularly by targeting seriously at-risk groups like young, black, gay, and bisexual men. \\\\nFor the CDC and advocacy groups, breaking the stigma and starting a more open conversation are the first steps. Then people can be guided to testing, told about drugs like Truvada that help prevent the spread of infections, get educated on the importance of other protection like condoms, and put on medication that reduces HIV viral loads and, as a result, reduces the disease’s deadliness and ability to spread. \\\\nKnowing first-hand how bad the misconceptions about HIV can get, Rawl has made it her life's calling to do the advocacy work, dissolve those stigmas, and start honest conversations about the disease. She travels the country to tell her story and what she’s overcome, and she hopes her memoir, Positive, which came out in August 2014, will help spread her story further. The education effort can get personal at times: Rawl sometimes has to convince parents of boyfriends that the disease isn’t as dangerous as it used to be. \\\\n\"I think this generation, our parents, grew up when the disease came out and scared people,\" she said. \"So they have a lot of that on the back of their minds, and they need more education on what it’s like now.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nInterviews: 8 people with HIV tell their stories \\\\n \\\\npaige,vanderek,leslie,danny,jimmy,tony,maliek,tommy \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl \\\\n \\\\nStraight womanLocation: Indianapolis, INDiagnosed: At birth \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:You realized that you’re HIV-positive at 12. What was it like for that to happen at such a young age? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:When I first found out, I didn’t really understand what the disease really meant or that there’s a stigma out there. When I told my best friend at the time, it spread throughout the entire middle school and I started being bullied. I really started to understand the disease, and understand that there’s a stigma out there and some people are never going to accept me for it. After everything I went through, though, I realized that having HIV shouldn’t define me. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:When a lot of people find out, they immediately think their lives are over. Were you too young to react in that way? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:I was too young. I thought that being HIV-positive was like having asthma. I didn’t really fully understand what exactly I was telling my friend at the time. I didn’t really understand what having this disease could mean until after I started getting the reactions from other people. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Is the deadly aspect something you think about today? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Today, I just look at it like it’s any other disease. I just take this one pill a day. I feel like HIV is one of the diseases that is a lot easier to live with now. It’s easier than some of the other diseases that are out there. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So for you it’s more a chronic illness than a terminal illness. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Right. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:You mentioned how coming out to your friends caused your status to spread through your school. Is that reaction — the bullying — something that you’ve seen a lot in your life? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Yeah. After coming out, I lost a lot of friends because of it. I was frequently beat up. I had a nickname that I was given. It was really hard for me. I was surprised at how people were treating me over something I was born with. \\\\nI believe everything happens for a reason, so all of it gave me a reason to go out and educate people so other people wouldn’t have to go through what I went through. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your friends explain those kinds of reactions to you? They were young at the time, but it seems shocking they just immediately turned on you and started bullying you. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:They just didn’t want to be around me, they didn’t want to hang out with me, and they were telling other kids not to drink after me because they’ll catch the disease. I think it was a lack of education; they just didn’t understand or know how to treat or be around someone who is HIV-positive. \\\\nThere’s so many negative things out there about the disease. I think they just took those, and that’s what they ran with. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did school officials handle all of this? Were they aware of it? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Once I went to the school counselor. All she really told me is that I could deny I’m HIV-positive. For me, that was bad. This was someone I thought I could go to, but I didn’t really receive the advice I thought I should be given. \\\\nThey thought I was just having problems. The kids who were making fun of me were supposed to be the good kids, with good grades. So the school counselor told me that they couldn’t suspend one bully because she’s a straight-A student. But the thing is I was a straight-A student until I started going through all the bullying. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So what did you end up doing? Did you change schools, or did you start getting homeschooled? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:After going to the counselor numerous times and after everything I went through, in my eighth grade year I withdrew from the school. I was homeschooled. It was really hard, because I was so involved. I did show choir, soccer, and all that. So homeschooling for me was really hard, but it was something I had to do because the bullying got so bad. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Did your grades noticeably drop during the bullying? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Yeah. During my seventh grade year, I started having stress-induced seizures for nine months because of the bullying. So I missed a lot of school, and my grades started going down noticeably. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your parents react to all of this? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:My mom was always there for me. But I didn’t fill her in with everything that was going on at school. I never told her I was going to tell my best friend; it just happened. So she didn’t even know I was having these problems until she was called down to my school. But I know it was hard for my mom through all the seizures and failing to get in touch with the school. She was just trying to find a way to help me through it. \\\\nBut she was there for me. I was able to talk to her. Once I was homeschooled, she actually stopped working because she had to be home with me everyday. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your mom’s boyfriend deal with all of this? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:He was supportive. Any time I had to go to the hospital, he was there. \\\\nHim and my mom are very protective of me. They were always making sure that nothing bad is going to happen to me. They were both very supportive and protective. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:In the aftermath of all of this, do you have new friends to fall back on? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:I just finished my freshman year at Ball State University, and I have friends that I hang out with all the time. I’m back to getting my straight A’s. So everything for me is going well. I’m always going to have the effects of what I went through, but it helps to have this support system. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you told your current friends about your status? How did they react? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:I’m actually very open about my HIV status. I speak all across the country to schools and different events. So it’s kind of hard for me to find a friend that doesn’t know about it. It’d be really surprising if I did, especially since I’ve spoken at my college about my HIV status and what I went through. \\\\nI like to get my HIV status, whether it’s friends or dating, out right in the beginning. That way if they have a problem, it saves me the trouble in the long-run. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do people react positively nowadays? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Usually, they do. I’ve had a couple problems in the past year, but I think it was just guys being ignorant. It wasn’t really people that I considered my friends. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Not to dwell on the negative, but I’m curious why those people still stigmatize you. What do you think? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:I don’t know if it’s a lack of education or ignorance or people just wanting to be mean. \\\\nOne time, walking back to my dorm, I was called \"the HIV girl\" by a group of guys. For me, it was hard. I was like, I’m in college. They’re adults now, and there shouldn’t be any of that going on. It’s surprising that at that old they’re still trying to say that I’m different from everybody else. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:If they see it as a serious disease, then they’re making fun of a sick person. To me, that seems so bizarre and backwards. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Yeah. It’s very weird. There’s just a lot of ignorance out there. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Has your status had an effect on your romantic relationships? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:It’s never really been the guy. It’s just once they tell their parents that they’re dating someone that’s HIV-positive, their parents start to get anxious and nervous and not okay with it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do the parents start intervening in the relationship? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:Yeah. They ask a lot of questions. They want to make sure that everything is okay. \\\\nI think this generation, our parents, grew up when the disease came out and scared people. So they have a lot of that on the back of their minds, and they need more education on what it’s like now. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:When you describe to them how it works now, how do they react? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:They’re more surprised that nowadays it can be that controlled. Once I go and explain how the disease is nowadays, how I take one pill a day, and how my viral load is undetectable, they loosen up a little and start to understand this isn’t such a big deal. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have there been any cases in which the parents refuse to change their minds about it? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:I luckily haven’t had a situation like that. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Since you’re publicly open about it, I’m curious if it’s affected other aspects of your life. Has it affected you in any social settings, like church, some clubs you’re involved in, or sports? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:During my eighth-grade year, there was a moment — my last straw before I left the school — when my soccer coach approached me and said, \"By the way, I heard you have AIDS. Is that true?\" I told him no, because there’s a difference between HIV and AIDS. But I was so young, and the fact she asked me in front of other players made it terrible. \\\\nMy mom confronted my coach. The coach made a joke to my mom that the team could use my HIV status to our advantage, because the players on the other team would be scared to touch me, and I could score goals. \\\\nThat’s when I decided this isn’t where I should be going to school. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:That sounds horrible. Was that the last bad experience in that kind of social setting? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:I’ve always had people say I can’t do something because I’m HIV-positive. But when someone tells me that I can’t do something because of my HIV status, it just makes me try to do that and more. In a way, it’s made me want to be even stronger. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Your mom is HIV-positive, too. Do you think that helped you cope with it through all of these issues? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:It has helped. It’s better to have someone who went through what I’m going through. I wrote a memoir that’s coming out this August, and my mom was there for all of it. Not only is she dealing with my HIV journey, she also has her own journey. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Tell me about your memoir. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPaige Rawl:It’s titled Positive. It’s coming out August 26. I’ve always wanted to write a book sharing my story. It tells my story from when my mom contracted the disease to everything I’m doing now. I hope it helps people who have been a victim of bullying because of their HIV status or any other reason. I try to show them and help them and let them know that it’s okay to ask for help. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"I knew if I gave in to suicidal thoughts, I’d be letting down the people that love me.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster \\\\n \\\\nGay manLocation: Birmingham, ALDiagnosed: 2014 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did you feel the moment you found out you’re HIV-positive? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:I was at my doctor’s office. I had been going for two or three weeks to figure out what was wrong, because I had been having some problems. \\\\nIt came to a point where I couldn’t work anymore. My job at the time — at Publix — depended on me being on my feet and walking around and helping people, and I couldn’t walk around. I decided I can’t work anymore, and I had to leave. \\\\nBack at the doctor, he called me in to give me my test results. He had asked me if I thought I could have AIDS, and I told him no. He brought me in the next week, and he’s like, \"Your test results came back positive.\" I took a deep breath and said, \"Okay.\" \\\\nI just accepted it in my head. Him asking me if I think I could have AIDS set me up so I could be okay with it. Well, I thought I was okay with it. I didn’t feel numb, depressed, or sad about it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:A few people have told me they were accepting or optimistic almost from the start. Did you approach your diagnosis in the same way? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:At first I did. But after having it settle for a while, I think my optimism was a front so people didn’t get sad around me. \\\\nWhen I told people, the first thing I told them was, \"I’m going to tell you something, and the last thing I want you to do is cry, because that would not help me.\" And only one person broke down and cried. \\\\nBut I had my moment when I cried. It didn’t last long, though. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How long after you found out did that happen? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:It was the following Saturday. \\\\nI cried because I knew I wasn’t going through it alone. My mom was here. Me being sick was just more stress on her. That thought made me break down, because the last thing I want to do is put more stress on my mom. I didn’t want to do that to her. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your mom react to all of this? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:She reacted surprisingly well. She was at work when I told her, so I think she couldn’t break down and cry. But even after then, I haven’t seen my mom cry about it. \\\\nShe’s taken me to all of my appointments. She’s tried to go in with me and talk to the doctor, but I have this thing inside the doctor’s office. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Would you say she’s been supportive then? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:Yeah. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How about other family members? Have you told them? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:Yes. I’d say that about 65 percent of my family is very supportive. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Is there a certain segment of your family that isn’t supportive, like your dad’s side? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:Yes, it’s my dad’s side, including my sister and probably my cousins. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Why do you feel that way? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:Well, I haven’t told them. But I suspect they would react negatively. \\\\nNot too long ago I told my dad that I’m gay, and he had a negative reaction to it. I told him, and he just walked away. That was the last time I spoke with him — in 2012. So I can only imagine how he would respond to this. I probably would be better off not telling him. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So do you plan to ever tell him? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:Not now, at least. Probably later on. Maybe when I have a clearer understanding of how he would react to it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How about your friends? Have you told them? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:I have three best friends. One of them, who I feel fortunate to have in my life, is also HIV-positive. He’s been very supportive and helpful. I told my other friends as well, and they’ve also been supportive. They all check on me and make sure I’m mentally and physically okay. \\\\nI lost 50 pounds, so I had to go through a wardrobe change. Some of my friends actually bought me new clothes and made sure I’m okay financially as well. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Did your friend who’s also HIV-positive help you through the situation? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:He definitely did. I probably wouldn’t have been so understanding of my situation had I not been so understanding of his. I would have broken down if he had not been here to help me. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:I know a lot of people react negatively at first because they assume they’re going to die. Do you think your friend shielded you from that reaction? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:He definitely did, because he was one of the first people I told. Initially he told me, \"Be calm. I’m here for you.\" After an hour of talking, he began asking me what I’m going to do with medication. He told me about the different medicines that are available. It was just a great talk. So he helped me understand what was really going on. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Has your diagnosis affected your romantic relationships? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:In my most recent relationship, I told him about it right after I was diagnosed. We tried to make it work, but I don’t think he understood what was going on with me. \\\\nI was hospitalized for pneumonia a week after I got my results. While I was in the hospital, he called me and told me he felt abandoned. It was a slap in the face. How did he feel abandoned when I was at the hospital going through this? He thought I should make a greater effort to be with him. So I ended up calling it off. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How sick were you when he told you that? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:I had been sick for about a week. I went in on a Tuesday. My cousin had come over, and she asked me if I was okay. I said no, but I couldn’t take my temperature because my thermometer was broken. So she told me to go to the doctor. \\\\nMy fever was 102 or 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The doctors immediately rushed me in. I had trouble breathing because I also have asthma, and I had problems keeping down food. I was there for about three days, until my temperature dropped. \\\\nIn the end, I found out I was no longer HIV-positive. I had AIDS, because my white blood cell count was so low. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did you feel at that point? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:It changed the frame of the issue for me. But, at the time, I had that same understanding reaction I had back at the doctor’s office. I’ve never been the type to cry, because I hate the type of vulnerability it causes. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Through all of this, the person you were with at the time told you he felt abandoned. How did you feel about that? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:It was ridiculous at the time. That’s probably when I felt the most emotion. He was also in the hospital for his diabetes, but I couldn’t get up at the time and go see him. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you been any relationships after him? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:I’m talking to someone now. He knows I’m HIV-positive. He says he’s okay with it, but I’m a believer in actions speak louder than words. We haven’t even had sex yet. So I’m waiting to see where we are at once we’re comfortable enough to have sex with each other. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you told any other communities you participate in, like church or theater group? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:I haven’t been back to church since Easter. That was before I had been diagnosed, but I had lost a lot of weight. One of the people jokingly asked if I had AIDS. After that, I decided I’m not going back. \\\\nWhen I found out about my status, that joke made me feel worse about the situation. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you found any supportive communities? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:There’s this group here called the ELITE Project. They’re like a big family for me. They’re a group with AIDS Alabama, and I go to them regularly for counseling. It’s somewhere I can get away from home, and where gay youth can just be ourselves. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have HIV/AIDS affected your job at all? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:I’m self-employed at the moment. I do graphic design and photography. \\\\nIt has affected me. I can’t stand up for more than 30 minutes, because my HIV works to make my asthma worse. So if I stand up for that long for my photography, I’ll fall back. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How have you dealt with that? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:It’s hard. I used to be active. Now, I’m just at home or always sitting. I can’t do too much running. It really has affected how I live my day-to-day life. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you expect that to get better over time? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:My doctors said it could go either way. It’s a matter of time to see if I get better. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:I assume that worries you a lot. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:Kind of. I could really benefit from having a job if I don’t get disability. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How are you paying for your treatments right now? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:My mom’s insurance. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So are you looking for another job? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:I’m looking for another job as well as doing my design. I’d like to work at a call center, as a receptionist, or somewhere else I could sit. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:A big aspect of HIV is the stigma that follows it. Have you run into problems with that? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:On social media, I’ve had someone attack me for having HIV. It’s very disheartening. It was a person I considered a friend. He also made a joke about someone looking like they belong on an HIV-positive dating website. It made me wonder what he would say about me behind my back. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do those kind of reactions make it harder for you to be open about your status? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:No, it doesn’t. I can’t do anything about another person’s ignorance, so I tend to let it go and move on from it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Given that HIV diagnoses are rising among young gay men, what would you say to someone who was just diagnosed? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nVanDerek Foster:Whatever you do, don’t lose who you are. It’s easy to for you to just lose yourself and give in, but you have to find something to hold onto. With me, it was my friends. I knew if I gave in to suicidal thoughts, I’d be letting down the people that love me. So I’m trying to hold on to all of those things. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"People are ignorant and not accepting of it. They think you have a plague they can get by touching you or whatever.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie \\\\n \\\\nStraight womanLocation: Little Rock, ARDiagnosed: 1999 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Walk me through when you were first diagnosed with HIV — where you were, how it felt. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I went to my annual test and mammogram. I did like I normally do my yearly. And when the results came back, the doctor had called me into the office. So when I went to the office, that’s when he pulled me into his office and he told me that my blood work came back positive for HIV. \\\\nI was like, \"Are you sure you got the right person? Do it again.\" So he redid it, and the same results came back. I was just devastated. I couldn’t believe that it actually happened to me. I thought I was being safe. The only person I was being intimate with, we had used protection. \\\\nI just felt like killing myself, because I know people are ignorant and not accepting of it. They think you have a plague they can get by touching you or whatever. It was like, my life is over, it’s a done deal. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:A lot of the people I’ve talked to have worried about the stigma mainly because of how it reflects on their sexuality. As a straight person, did you feel a stigma as well? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I just see it as being across the board. Nobody is a stranger or immune to the stigma. That’s about as much thought as I’ve given it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How open are you about being HIV-positive? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I disclosed to my immediate family, because I got sick back in 2003 or 2004. I got really ill, and the doctors weren’t expecting me to survive, so it was disclosed then. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your family react? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:My kids were mad. They felt that my husband at the time had given it to me, but that wasn’t the person that actually gave it to me. My sisters, one of them basically lost it. My mom was pretty much the same. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you know the person who gave it to you, and do you know if he was aware that he was HIV-positive? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I haven’t talked to that person. I don’t know if he knew or not. But I mean, why do me like this? I had been with this man since my little girl was eight months. I felt betrayed. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Was your mom upset? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:She was hurt. Like I said, the whole family was hurt because it started to touch home. Everything you instill in your child, you want them to make the right decisions, and things just happen. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Has the stigma been a problem in your family at all? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:When I went to visit my aunt and cousins in Atlanta, we sat down and talked. I explained to them, \"You can touch me, you can hug me, I’m still the same person. The only thing different is I have to take medication, I have to take care of myself, and my health comes first. But I’m still your cousin, I’m still that same person. I haven’t changed.\" I had to let them know that you can’t tell someone has HIV just by looking at them. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do any of your friends know? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:No. I have friends, but I don’t feel I need to disclose that information to them, because I’ve looked at how others have disclosed their HIV status and how they’ve been treated. So I’ve told my family, and nobody else knows. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Are you worried your friends and community will reject you? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:Yes, because Arkansas is really small. Ignorance is bliss. \\\\nIn the end, I do have kids, so if someone finds out here, what kind of retaliation would be done to my children? I look at it from that aspect, because I do have grandkids as well. It’s just safe with my immediate family, and I’m comfortable with that. I don’t want anyone else to know outside of my position. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:What have you seen with other people coming out that’s made you so worried? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:My sister’s sister-in-law died from AIDS. I saw how her mother treated her, and that was really hurtful. I have another friend that’s HIV-positive, and I’ve seen how his family does him. I don’t want to be treated like that. Like my doctor said, I’ll probably outlive some of these people that don’t have HIV/AIDS. But it goes back to us being in a small state, people run their mouths, and not everyone is accepting. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So what kind of effect has this had on your relationships? What relationships were you in since you were diagnosed? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I was married in 2002, and I got divorced in 2005 or 2006. That’s it. \\\\nI just don’t let any male friend get close enough to me to be in a serious relationship, just because of my status. If you start divulging certain information, how would that person take it and use it against you? So I just kind of shut down with the relationship issues. I just talk with others just to keep my mind off of it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Did you disclose to your husband, and did you guys take precautions? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:He found out when I got sick. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So he didn’t know until then? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:Right. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Did you feel bad about that? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:Yes and no. I mean, we were using condoms. After he found out, my mom told him to get tested. So I don’t know if he did or he didn’t — I don’t even know how to get in contact with him now. There was a lot of stuff that led up to our divorce, and we had to get a restraining order. It was just really hard. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Another aspect of living with HIV is whether it could affect you at your workplace. Do you feel that’s impacted your job at all? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I work at a stressful job. I have to be mindful of how it affects my immune system. So I try not to stress as much, but it’s hard. I am undetectable, but the stress can cause me to get sick. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you ever gotten sick and had to call off work because of stress? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:No. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So would you say it’s affected your work at all? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:No, it hasn’t affected my work. My meds recently got switched, and the doctors did that on a Friday to see how they would work through the weekend. I was a little nauseous, but other than that I was able to go back to work. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Given your concerns about the stigma, what would you say to anyone thinking about disclosing their status? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:Make sure that that is something they’ve thought through. Once that’s out there, there’s no way to take it back. Especially if you have kids, you have to really think about that. Just be mindful that once it’s out there and people know it, are they going to be compassionate or are they going to look at you like you have a plague? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:You’ve mentioned your kids a few times. Is that the biggest fear with the stigma for you? What do you think would happen to them if you said something? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I just think everyone’s going to treat them bad. Saying things like, \"Oh, her momma’s got the package.\" I don’t even want to put my children through that. That’s why I don’t tell people. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you think it would feel good, personally, to come out to people? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:I would like to be able to tell people. Then I could be a good spokesperson for the issue, because I am a people person. But not everyone is understanding. \\\\nI kind of talk to a few ladies that I’ve crossed that I see are promiscuous, and I let them know that HIV/AIDS is real, it don’t care who you have sex with, and this is something you can have for the rest of your life. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:It sounds like it still weighs you down every day. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nLeslie:It does. I ask myself everyday, \"Why me?\" I wasn’t one of those people they talk about that had sex with everybody and anybody. I was just having sex with one person. \\\\nBut I deal with the cards that I’m dealt. I try to stay upbeat and smile. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"I could demonstrate with my own testimony and my own life that HIV doesn’t win unless you give it the victory.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris \\\\n \\\\nGay or bisexual manLocation: Little Rock, ARDiagnosed: 2006 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:What was it like when you found out you were HIV-positive? How did you feel? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:My infection happened due to an act of violence. When I started getting sick after the event, I kind of suspected that’s what was going on. I had the doctor give me the diagnosis. \\\\nIt was January when I was attacked, and in June I was sick, and I had the diagnosis by the end of June. \\\\nMy initial feeling was a numbness. I didn’t know what to think, because I didn’t have any type of education on it. I didn’t know anything about it. I wasn’t prepared to deal with HIV. I just had a feeling of being lost. \\\\nEven after seeing the doctor on that first day, I was left without any type of resource or information to help me to deal with it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Especially given how your infection came through an act of violence, I imagine that must have made the whole event feel much, much worse. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:It took a while, because I was dealing with those types of things. There had been years with just battling within me: Are you gay? Are you straight? Are you gay? Are you straight? I never really fit in. \\\\nWhen I was physically attacked, I knew it was wrong, and I hated that it happened, but at first there was a lot of confusion with how to deal with any of it. \\\\nSince I didn’t really have anyone to talk to, it just sat there in a state of confusion for, I’d say, at least year. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How long did it take to start talking to people? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:By the end of that year, there was a support group that I was recommended to. We could talk to each other on an intellectual level. They helped me find my way through that confusion and helped me to make a solid base underneath all of it, so I could deal with all of the above. \\\\nI would say it was within two years before I started talking to a lot of people. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:That’s a long time. How did you feel during those two years, keeping it secret? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I felt insignificant. I felt there was no purpose for me in life anymore. Everything that was near and dear to me was no longer available to me. I was trying to figure out what the rest of life was going to be like. \\\\nI had a particularly bad experience with the Department of Health that led me to believe that everybody would now know about my status. So not knowing what it means or what it represents except for death, it was just not something I could sort through. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Once you started treatment, how did that change your perspective? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:Through the conversations with this man who helped me at the support group, he helped me understand what it meant. When I saw my numbers begin to change, I began to feel better. My perspective began to change, and I began to understand that this was something I could work with, deal with, manage, and actually overcome. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Once you started feeling safer with the disease, did you start coming out to your family? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I waited until 2010. I have four children, and I have several brothers and sisters. We’re all very close, and we’ve always been close. We have a little group on Facebook that’s just for us — a private room. I went on Facebook and made the announcement to everybody, so I could make sure that everybody got it at the same time and got the same message. \\\\nBy then, I was completely understanding of what was going on, I knew where I was at, and I knew what I could accomplish. So I was willing to make that disclosure to everybody. \\\\nOne of my children had a little problem. He was afraid that I was dying. It’s taken a while to help him understand that it doesn’t mean death anymore. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Were your parents around for this? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:No. My parents had already passed away. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:What was the general reaction from your family? Was it supportive? Was it what you expected? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I’ve had nothing but support from my family. They don’t make an issue of the HIV, nor do I. I’m just Danny, and I’m living my life, they’re living their lives, and when we get together we enjoy ourselves. They’re not timid with touch or hug; they let me play with their kids; and they let me play football. There’s no hesitancy. \\\\nBut my family is all professionals. There’s a minister, a schoolteacher. They’re all professionals. They have a little bit of background to know that it’s not something to be afraid of. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Has your family always been supportive through these kind of tough issues? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:Absolutely. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How about your friends? How did they react to it, if you told them? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:At first, I was more afraid of disclosing to my friends and my peers and the people I worked with than I was with my family. I didn’t ever want to be perceived as a victim or that I was something less than everyone else. Since 2010, I’ve actually been working in the HIV outreach field, and I was still hesitant to disclose my status for fear of those very reasons. \\\\nAfter a while, I began to think it through and decided it was better that it be known. I could demonstrate with my own testimony and my own life that HIV doesn’t win unless you give it the victory. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So did you take longer to tell your friends then? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I would say it took until 2011 for me to become more open with the people I work with. At that point, I took an outreach position, so I was traveling the state working with support groups, doing HIV testing, and working with people who didn’t know their status or were finding out their status. At that point, I was a perfect source for them. They could look at me and see I was nothing but Danny. There’s nothing there that they could fear. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So how did your friends and coworkers react when they found out? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I’ve not had anyone who’s been negative about it. But I work in the HIV field. So for somebody to be negative to that, it would have been hypocritical toward what we do. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How about your romantic relationships? What kind of effect has this had since you found out? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:At first, dealing with the Department of Health, I was led to believe that I was not allowed to have sex anymore. The doctor never would broach that subject, so I always felt that it was wrong for me to even think about it. What if I infected someone else? \\\\nSince that time, I’ve had one relationship. I was with a gentleman who was also HIV-positive, and he was a long-term survivor. \\\\nAt this point, I only date other positives. We discuss it going in, and it’s not an issue. Since people know who I am and what I do around the area, they already know going in. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Are you still nervous about dating someone who’s HIV-negative? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:Yes. If I meet someone I really like, I always worry about that. Do they know? How are they going to react? That’s why I generally try to date positives and tend to make it easier for myself. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you come out to a bigger community, like a church or theater group? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I was a member of a Methodist church here in Little Rock. I was actually facilitating one of the Sunday morning classes, and the subject I was teaching worked well with my personal story, and I took the opportunity to just share with the class. There were about 30 people in the room, most of them older, and I could see in their faces that about half them dealt with it okay and about half of them did not. A couple of them discontinued coming to the class. I didn’t feel like it was accepted as well. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did you feel about that? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I’ve been in church all my life, and I’ve seen the best times and worst times. It seems like in the faith community we often wind up shooting our wounded. We don’t want to be reminded that we’re all flawed and we all have problems and we all have issues to deal with. \\\\nTo them, living in Arkansas, being HIV-positive communicates a lot of things. It communicates that he’s gay, he’s nasty, and he’s having random sex with all kinds of different people. That’s what it communicates to that type of group here in Arkansas. \\\\nSo I knew going in that it would probably be a difficult thing for some of them. But if we’re going to change the stigma, we have to make the disclosure. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:The strange thing to me, though, is your infection came through an act of violence. Did you tell that to the group, and did they still react that way knowing that information? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:Yes. It’s still the same. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Why do you think that is? Do you think the stigma is just too strong? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I think it’s because I’m a man. They just don’t perceive that men are attacked. They don’t see an act of violence or rape in a situation like me — that somehow I should have been able to stop that. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:That seems like blaming the victim to me. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:Yeah. That’s what I feel in my heart is the main problem. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:It must not be easy. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I understand that that’s part of it. I’m trying to be one to break down those stigmas. At 52 years old, what else can I do with this? I’m just a grandfatherly old man. \\\\nWhen people see me, they’re often surprised when I tell them I do have HIV. You can tell they’re taken aback, because we still live in a state here that thinks you can get it from kissing someone or sitting on a toilet seat. \\\\nWhen I tell them that, they see a different side to HIV that they’ve not been shown. All they’ve been shown is the movie Philadelphia. All they’ve seen is the death. I’m showing them it’s about living and achieving and finding purpose in life. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How would you say this all affected your religious perspective? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I’ve always been a little more on the liberal side in my interpretation. For me, I don’t that have a lot of stomach for organized religion anymore. I think we kind of missed the boat — we made churches irrelevant because we’re not reaching the people that are hurting, the people that religion is what they need. \\\\nMatthew chapter 25 talks about the parable of accountability. The judge says, \"Well done. When I was sick, you came to see me. When I was hungry, you fed me. When I was naked, you clothed me.\" The judged asks, \"When did I do that?\" The judge says, \"When you did it to the least of us you did them to me.\" As I see it, that’s the basic part of ministry — when you find ways to take care of the most basic needs of people and doing it in the right attitude, with the right heart. That communicates so many things to people, and that’s what I do. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:In a way, do you feel like you’re making up for what the organized sections of your religion aren’t doing? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:Absolutely. I go places they don’t go or won’t go. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:What do you make of the recent uptick in diagnoses among young people? What do you tell these younger clients when you talk to them? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:I try to be as real as I can. I do a lot more educating than counseling. I try to help them understand the way HIV is transmitted — the bodily fluids that are involved. \\\\nThen we talk real about what kind of sex you’re having, how you’re having sex, and some basic instructions on how to most protect yourself. If I go in and just say, \"Okay, slap a condom on,\" most of them will immediately turn me off. You talk about condoms, but you need to talk about other things you can do to mitigate the risk. \\\\nI just get as much information as I can out there to continue to reduce the risk. Hopefully along the way the light will go off inside their minds. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How much success do you see with these consultations? Are these younger clients actually reducing their viral loads, as far as you know? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDanny Harris:The medicines work. We know that. If you’re taking your medicine, your viral load is going to reduce and go to undetectable. \\\\nWhen I talk to especially the younger generation, and they tell me their viral loads aren’t coming down, I just don’t take their answer. I tell them, \"You’re not taking your meds.\" \\\\nIt’s a simple process: if you take your meds, your viral load is going to come down. It’s just a matter of finding the right kind of medication that works with their lifestyle. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"I knew right then that my life had to change dramatically, because HIV was not going to kill me, it was not going to be what took me down.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker \\\\n \\\\nGay manLocation: Little Rock, ARDiagnosed: 2006 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did you feel when you were first diagnosed? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:I was at Atlanta at the time, and I had just graduated from college as an adult. It was a pretty big accomplishment for me. I felt really sick, and I couldn’t really figure out what was going on. I went to the hospital, was there for four days. The fourth day, I finally got someone to talk to me because no one had said anything to me the whole time I was in there. \\\\nThe doctor came that morning and said he had run a full gamut of tests to see if I contracted any kinds of diseases, and he told me all of those came back fine — but my HIV test came back positive. Then he walked out of the room and left me there. \\\\nI was shocked. My first response was to text my partner to tell him he needs to come to the hospital. But I didn’t really break down. \\\\nSince I was 19 years old when I moved away from home to be gay and get out of the South, I had a lot of friends and had seen people dying from AIDS at the time with no treatment. \\\\nI had got tested very regularly ever since then — since around 1989. So when the test came back positive, I was shocked. \\\\nI didn’t really let it affect me, but it affected my relationship. I had a lot of things I was dealing with. I was addicted to meth at the time. I knew right then that my life had to change dramatically, because HIV was not going to kill me, it was not going to be what took me down. From there, it was a process of putting one foot in front of the other and doing the right thing. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:You mentioned you had just finished college when you found out. Being diagnosed must have been a devastating contrast to your achievement. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:It was just bad. As a matter of fact, my diagnosis and my addiction affected everything from that point. My degree was in fashion design, and my options for successful work in that field were New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. I knew I had to get out of Atlanta, and I just couldn’t make a decision to move to one of those cities knowing what I was up against with my health and my addiction at the same time and think I could survive. I knew that I had to get someplace away from the drugs, and I had to find a healthy environment. So it was just a wasted education. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How involved were you with drugs at the time? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:Over the period of 10 years in Atlanta, my meth addiction progressed to daily use. I was never an injection drug user, although the one time I did stick a needle in my arm was a couple months before my diagnosis. I’m pretty sure that’s where my HIV came from. \\\\nWhen I told one of my friends at the time, all he could focus on was that I used a needle. He just asked me why I did it. \\\\nSo I was a daily meth user. I was highly functional, but it was killing me. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you completely stopped since then? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:Absolutely. I left Atlanta in November 2007, and I never looked back. I knew the drugs could no longer be a part of my life, and I’ve stayed sober ever since. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How was the process of coming out to your family? How did they react? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:My mother is my best friend. It was hard. I had to tell her face-to-face, since I didn’t want to tell her over the phone. She knew long before I got there that something was wrong. It was eight weeks after I was diagnosed that I was able to get home. \\\\nI had a tumultuous relationship with my father, who’s a minister, all of my life, but I had an instant moment of clarity. I couldn’t let my mom deal with it all on her own, so I had to tell my father as well, and it needed to be from me. \\\\nIt wasn’t easy to do, but it was probably the best thing that’s ever happened for me and my father. We developed a relationship over six or seven years that I just never dreamed would happen, and it happened from that day forward. \\\\nFor my extended family, it was later in the year that I went to a family reunion. That’s when I really realized I’m HIV-positive, and I had a complete breakdown at the hotel. My entire family rallied and supported me ever since. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:The story with your dad seems remarkable. I’ve heard a bit about fears that families will reject HIV-positive members. For you, it seems like the opposite happened. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:It did. It goes back to what I told my mom years ago: I had to know because of what I watched. It was so alone. I had to know where my support was coming from. The reason I told them was for that reason only: I had to know if they were going to support me. If they didn’t, I didn’t have time for that. \\\\nThe reaction was just amazing. As an advocate here in Arkansas, I tell people, \"Tell your families. They’ll surprise you.\" I know there’s a lot who don’t get that support, but there’s so many who can have it if they just reach out. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your friends react to the diagnosis? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:After my diagnosis, I realized I have to get to get out of Atlanta, get to where it’s safe, and live my life. I changed everything, and my old friends never had anything to do with me again. They haven’t visited me, and they’ve never called me. I’ve never heard from them again. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:What happened after the split with your Atlanta friends? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:I decided I’d go back to school to get my degree in nursing, so I could be a traveling nurse and wouldn’t have to make any attachment to anybody. I didn’t want to be attached to anyone anywhere. The separation of my friends through the diagnosis was extremely devastating to me, and I just set my life up so I wouldn’t have to worry about it. \\\\nI recently graduated with my second degree. It was not in nursing; that didn’t work out. But in the process of being here, I managed to get a job at my doctor’s office. In the course of that job, I got hired by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to be the central advocate in Arkansas. \\\\nPart of my job was to start a support group, and part of that curse — not really a curse, but I thought it at the time — was one of the ladies in the group got attached to me and basically made me become her friend. The support group is my family. The people that come to my support group are worrisome as hell, but I know if I needed anything all I have to do is pick up the phone and they’re there. \\\\nNow, when I look at the life I was living in Atlanta, it was probably for the best that I left. I didn’t need that influence. I needed a clean break. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your diagnosis affect your romantic relationships? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:Well, I left my ex in Atlanta. He was a drinker, which I realized pretty quickly. It was all in all a good relationship — except by 8 every night, he couldn’t remember what happened between the hours of 5 and 8. I was a bit disillusioned, but I made a conscious decision to stay in the relationship because I figured people had to settle with what’s closest to what they want. \\\\nOver the course of 10 years, he was brave enough to try different things with me. But he was always a little skeptical and afraid of catching something. Once I found out I had HIV, it felt like it had been everything he warned me about. So when I found out, I broke it off without question. \\\\nSince then, I dated one guy. Before we were really out of the door, I told him I’m HIV-positive. He gasped and told me he didn’t know what to say. He said he wasn’t sure how he was going to tell me that he was HIV-positive, too. I told him he was an idiot, and he just needed to say it. But that didn’t work out, because I found out he was cheating on me. I actually found out through the Health Department, because they told me that I had been exposed to syphilis. \\\\nI’ve tried dating people. It’s not been an issue of being positive. The harder issue is that I’m a recovering addict. I lose more relationships because people don’t want to let go of their drugs. \\\\nBut right now I do have a serious contender. He’s the guy I’ll spend the rest of my life with, if I have anything to do about it. He’s also positive, and we were both very upfront from the very beginning. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How about the communities you’re involved in? Do they know about your HIV diagnosis? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:I went to a church here, and I disclosed to a group there. I didn’t get any negative reactions. \\\\nBut I don’t go to church there anymore. I don’t go to church anywhere. I get too frustrated. The definition of Christianity is Christ-like, and I fail to see why the leaders of these organizations ever consider that their rules and judgments against their congregation have anything to do with what Christ was like. To put myself in that situation every week and deal with it, I won’t go there. \\\\nI still have faith, but it’s not something I go to church for. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Are there any other communities you’re involved in? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:The only other community I’m involved in here is the theater community, and that community is pretty strong. The community I’m involved in is issue-conscious, so it focuses on issues facing gays, Jewish people, and black people. \\\\nWhen we were rehearsing Raft of the Medusa, the issue came up. One guy said people transmitted HIV knowing they had the disease. It just blew all over me. I asked him, \"Are you serious? You really think people who are HIV-positive try to infect everybody?\" I mean, I know there are some people who go out and intentionally try to infect other people. But that shouldn’t be the perception. \\\\nThat kind of outed me in the theater. It was the first time I came out in a really social way. \\\\nThey were completely supportive. Through that conversation, the young man pulled me out at night and asked me where he could go because he’s HIV-positive. Suddenly, the whole rehearsal made sense. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:One thing I’ve heard a lot is that people are really afraid to come out as HIV-positive. Then they come out, and it goes much better than they expected. It seems like that’s something you’ve gone through too. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:Oh, yeah. \\\\nThe first day I met Leslie, one of my clients, she hated me. But she said one of the things that made her love me is that I act like I want to run down the streets of Little Rock with a big red ribbon on my shirt and tell everyone I’m positive. She said no one in her life was willing to take that kind of stance and support her. \\\\nAs an advocate, I’m just able to tell people that with treatment your numbers will improve. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:In your case, it seems like coming out has been helpful to others on top of being personally gratifying. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nJimmy Walker:Yeah. It’s kind of what I live for. It’s what makes me get up in the morning. It’s what makes me not quit my job. There are days when I want to throw my hands up, but I can’t. Even trying to make a transition — I’m in graduate school now — I don’t think I’m ever going to be able to change my career path. I love what I do. I love being able to get the right information to people. I love letting them know that life can be anything you want it to be. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"Some people still have this antiquated idea that you can’t be around a person with HIV without being at risk. Come on, people.\" \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\nTony Walker \\\\n \\\\nGay manLocation: Birmingham, ALDiagnosed: 1993 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Take me back to when you first found out you’re HIV-positive. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:Well, I found out before there was really any medication for it. It was pretty much a death sentence. I purposely didn’t go on medication because I felt the medication was doing more harm than the actual disease to people. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Back in 1993, was it much more devastating to find out you had the disease? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:I found out in the summertime. I honestly thought that by the time winter came, I was going to catch a cold or pneumonia and die. I stopped dreaming. I was 25 or 26 years old, and I said screw that. I just kind of sat there and waited for death to happen. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How was telling your friends and family about it? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:I just told them about it. I didn’t feel comfortable telling them until now. I had told my friends and family about my homosexuality, and they were accepting of that. But because of the stigma attached to HIV, I just didn’t think they were going to be accepting of that. Thankfully, I was wrong. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did you come out to your friends and family? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:I told my family as I started to work with AIDS Alabama. \\\\nI had an interesting conversation with an older man, and he told me this story about his brother about how his family found out he was positive after the brother died. He told me, \"I wish my brother told me he was sick.\" I asked, \"Well, what would you do if you knew?\" He said, \"I don’t know. He should have told us. That was a horrible way to find out.\" Then I pointed out the stigma. But he made a good point: \"If my brother had told me he was sick, he wouldn’t have had to die alone.\" \\\\nAt that point, it made me think about my folks. I wouldn’t want them to find out any other way than me telling them. So I went ahead and made that happen. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your status affect your relationships? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:Some people shied away. Other people were like, \"Okay, I’m with you.\" \\\\nI’ve been in a relationship for six years with a guy who’s negative. He’s been very, very supportive. We actually adopted a nine-year-old last year. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Even though your viral load is low, do people seem to react with fear? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:Yes. I dated this guy for about two months. Right before we got ready to get closer, I told him and he couldn’t deal with it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did your current partner react to it? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:He knew from day one, and he didn’t mind. He had dated someone who was positive before, so he was very educated on it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:So how does that work? Do you just insist on protection? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:When we first started, we used protection. But he kept pressuring me not to use protection, and we stopped for a bit. \\\\nAt that point, I thought he’s either lying about being negative or he has a death sentence. He told me that he just thought there was a very low chance of him catching it, since my viral load was undetectable. \\\\nBut then I fell in love with him. I was like, we need to stop this. I told him to go get tested, because I need to know whether or not you’re crazy or lying to me. He got tested, and he was negative. He’s remained negative. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How have people in your community, such as your church, reacted? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:I haven’t made a proclamation at church. But I’ve done some education for high school students. It’s been pretty well received. \\\\nThe people at my church, though, are involved with the HIV clinic. So they’re better versed on HIV than most people here in the South. So I think once it does come to light, I don’t think it’s going to be a big issue for them to overcome. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:From what you’ve told me, it sounds like you were worried about coming out, but those results were never realized. Is that right? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:Yeah. I feel like a total dumb-dumb about it. \\\\nI feel like coming out has also helped me show other people that the stigma isn’t really correct. Some people still have this antiquated idea that you can’t be around a person with HIV without being at risk. Come on, people. This is 2014. We should know better. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you feel you’re lucky that the reception has been generally positive? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:On one hand, I think I’m extremely lucky. On the other, I think if other people do what I’ve done they’d be happier. \\\\nIt’s just like being gay. Twenty years ago, it was a very bold move to tell my folks that I’m gay. Twenty years ago, if you turned on the television, you didn’t hear anything good about gay people. But we have become more open with our identities, and it’s being slowly destigmatized. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you think it’s important, then, for people to come out as HIV-positive to show that you can be completely normal? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:Most definitely. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:What else would you like people to know about your experience? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTony Walker:The stigma is self-imprisoning. You put yourself in prison when you worry about what people are going to say. The people who care, they shouldn’t matter. So there’s no reason to punish ourselves. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"I have to take a pill everyday, and I have to worry about getting a cold. It’s just little stuff. I don’t brush it off, but I don’t sit in it.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell \\\\n \\\\nGay manLocation: Birmingham, ALDiagnosed: 2012 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Tell me about the moment you found out you’re HIV-positive. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:I received a phone call from the Health Department. I thought it was a joke. As much as the caller was asking me for information, I was also asking him for information. He told me to come down to the Health Department, because somebody I had been with had tested positive for HIV. I asked him his name, what office he worked in, his title. \\\\nAfter we got off the phone, I googled that caller, and I looked at the Health Department number just to make sure this was a real call. I called back, and asked for the person who called me. I told him I had to make sure I knew this was a real. \\\\nDown here, in the South, when you do hear about HIV, it’s in a joking way. People really don’t take it too seriously. They’re usually saying it to hurt somebody or joking about it. \\\\nI ended up going to the Health Department on a Friday. I went with my partner at the time. Of course, we had to wait on the HIV results, and it was a weekend. \\\\nBut by Monday evening, I didn’t receive a call back. I thought maybe it’s a good thing I haven’t received a call, or maybe it’s not. So I called. He told me I needed to come back in. \\\\nAt the time, I didn’t have a vehicle to come back in. So I said I need to know what’s wrong, and I already waited the whole weekend. He told me that I was HIV-positive. \\\\nAs I was hanging up the phone, my sisters and my mother were coming through the door. Before my mom got out of the way, I went out the door and closed it behind me, and I immediately told her. She was the first person I told. \\\\nI cried. At the same time, my initial reaction was, \"Okay, after I finish crying, we need to figure out what we need to do now.\" \\\\nThat’s just how my family is, though. My mom is a quadriplegic. My aunt is an amputee. I just come from a strong background of people. So if something comes up, we take it on. \\\\nFrom then, it was a matter of getting in treatment. I started treatment on the day of my birthday: July 12, 2012. \\\\n \\\\nFor a whole year, I went without telling almost anyone. The only people I told were my immediate family, except my sisters. My family is my support team. I used that year as a moment of my personal therapy. I researched. I looked at people who were open about their status, networking with people, talking to people on Facebook. \\\\nI knew I didn’t want this to be a secret. Anybody that knows me knows that I’m pretty much an open book: what you see is what you get. I wasn’t going to let HIV define or change me. \\\\nI asked people how they got to the point where they were okay telling people they’re HIV-positive. Those were the people I followed. I needed to know what I needed to expect. \\\\nA year after I found out, I decided to post my status on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Mind you, this was news to pretty much everybody — except for my support system, my family. \\\\nI wasn’t really thinking about reactions. But I got great responses. \\\\nFrom there, I started volunteering for HIV prevention and outreach. I had always been involved in my community. So I had to do that work to prove I’m still Maliek. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:You mentioned your family was supportive. Was this true for everyone in your family? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:My mother’s reaction was that she embraced me. My family in general is very supportive. \\\\nNow, my dad is outside the family. Before I spoke to him, I ended up going to the hospital and I had the flu. I called him, and I told him I’m in the hospital. He knew that something was wrong, so it didn’t take him by surprise. But my dad isn’t supportive at all. We’ve never had the best relationship, probably because of my lifestyle. \\\\nMy mom makes me feel like we’re in this together. My dad, I don’t get that from him. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did it go with your friends when you told them? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:I actually told my close friends before it got on Facebook. It was about five of us. They were very supportive. Initially, I think it caught them off-guard. It pulled some of us together, but it pushed some of us apart. \\\\nFrom there, it was a ripple effect. My friends know, my family knows, this guy I’m involved with knows. So then I put it on Facebook. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have any of those friends that were pushed apart come back since then? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:Yeah. Everyone that was in my group, all of them are in a good space now. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How about your broader community? I’m thinking church or any other sort of social group. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:I do go to church. My mom has an outreach ministry, so I know people in her world know. I consider myself a pastor kid almost, because coming up that’s all we hung around. They have been supportive. I haven’t gotten any negativity as far as I know. \\\\nOne of my mom’s church friends had a fishing show, and she invited me to be in it. Just little things like that help. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Did your status affect your romantic relationships at all? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:The guy I first told, who’s HIV-negative, and I are kind of on a break. I can say a lot of stuff played a part in getting us to this break, but my HIV status was not one of the issues. My status never played a big part. Then again, this is as far as I know. \\\\nAlthough at one point he told me, \"Sometimes I don’t think you have HIV, because I never even see it.\" I was like, \"Well, this isn’t something you can see.\" He said, \"Well, I don’t see you taking your pills or anything.\" \\\\nBefore that point, he never had seen me taking my pills because it was something that I tried to keep from him. This was a whole new ballgame. I didn’t want to put too much on him at one time. \\\\nBut when I first started doing outreach, he was there every step of the way. Really, the problems we had we would have had even if I didn’t have HIV. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Were there any other relationships in this time span? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:I had a few former relationships come back in my life. One guy in particular that I was kicking it with, I knew that I couldn’t take it to that level. I just wasn’t ready to take it to that level. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:One issue I’ve heard a bit about is the perceived stigma. I’ve heard from a couple people that they were terrified to come out as HIV-positive, but once they did they realized there was nothing to fear. Did you share that experience at all? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:I totally agree. I thought, why did I wait a year? As soon as I posted my status, I just kept wondering that. It could have been easier not going through that year. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:You sound fairly happy overall. Do you feel optimistic about how you’re dealing with the disease? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nMaliek Powell:I do. Just like anybody, I have my moments. I have to take a pill everyday, and I have to worry about getting a cold. It’s just little stuff. I don’t brush it off, but I don’t sit in it. That was something that I’ve always seen my mom do, and I never saw her sit in her pity. That’s what I have to do. There’s plenty of times when I don’t want to get out of bed, but I don’t sit in it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"I get the opportunity to be the voice for those who feel they can’t talk about it or feel like they’ve lost hope.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett \\\\n \\\\nTransgender womanLocation: Little Rock, ARDiagnosed: 2012 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did you find out you have HIV? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:I was losing my hearing. I was getting my hearing test done, and waiting to get my hearing aids fit in. I told the audiologist that my hearing has worsened. She was concerned because it had only been three weeks from getting a hearing test. So she set up an appointment with another doctor. \\\\nGoing to talk with the doctor, he told me there was some hearing loss for sure, and he used a scope and went inside my nose, and he saw that my left node in my neck was swollen. He gave me a scare that it was lymphoma. I went and had an MRI, and it wasn’t lymphoma. \\\\nThen he asked me about my HIV status. I told him I didn’t have it. He set up another appointment, and I had the test done. A week later, I got a call and found out I was HIV-positive. \\\\nI felt fear, like I was going to die. I didn’t know what I would be able to do, because I knew that I didn’t have the money to pay for any medication. I had already heard about how expensive the medicines were. \\\\nInstead of giving up, I went to others to see what other people knew about what resources are out there. I got online. In talking with a friend in Memphis, she assured me that if Memphis, Tennessee, has resources available for people living with HIV/AIDS, then Little Rock, being the capital of Arkansas, most definitely should. \\\\nSo I looked it up online, the Arkansas AIDS Foundation came up. I called, and I spoke with a doctor at the foundation who told me that my best route would be to get in contact with ARK Care. \\\\nI called ARK Care. They asked me for some personal information to fill out that shows I’m HIV-positive and my financial position. They determined I’m eligible for the Ryan White Program, and with that I would get my medicine, and I would have access to therapists if I needed because I felt depressed or anything. In speaking with ARK Care, they also gave me a list of specialists here in Arkansas that I could choose from. \\\\nSo I called the specialists, and some of them had appointments two to three weeks out, and that’s what made me freak out. I was like, no, no, no. Then I found a clinic that was sponsoring a study for HIV-positive people, and they told me I could come the next day. That’s what I did, and I became one of their patients. This was months after I found out. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How soon did your family find out? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:I later spoke at an LGBT conference — the first one ever in northwest Arkansas. That prompted me to tell the rest of my family, because the only person I had told was my mom. \\\\nMy mom told me that in time I would tell the rest of my family, but she wasn’t going to do it for me. So it was our little secret for almost a year — until I did the LGBT summit. \\\\nI felt okay then. I told the rest of the world, I should tell my family. That’s what prompted me to tell my sisters and my brothers, and they told their children. I have a very, very strong support network as far as my family and friends. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How did it go when you told your mom first? How did she react? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:I went in. My mom doesn’t see me often, so she was pretty happy to see me. I put down my bags, and I sat down on these loveseats with her. \\\\nI asked her, \"How are you doing?\" She told me how she was doing, the little health problems she has. And I said, \"Well, since you mentioned it, how do I look?\" She said, \"You look like a girl!\" I said, \"No, besides that! How do I look? Do I look healthy?\" She said, \"Yeah. You look fat.\" So I was like, \"Okay, besides that, I have something to tell you.\" And I told her that I found out that I’m HIV-positive. \\\\nShe looked at me with silence. It lasted for maybe 10 seconds, and I thought she was uncomfortable. \\\\nI told her, \"I’m okay, mom. I promise I’m healthy. I’m taking my medicine.\" I went inside my bag, and grabbed my medicine to show her I am on medication. \\\\nHer words to me were, \"Okay. Just as long as you’re okay. Continue to do what the doctors say. You know I love you and support you and I’m going to be here.\" She told me that I could always tell her anything, and I didn’t have to take that long in telling her. \\\\nI explained to her that in listening to different people share their stories, some of their family members rejected them. I told her I was just scared, that I know I could always talk to her, but this was different, and I didn’t want to make her see me differently. \\\\nI eventually told the rest of my family by phone. A couple of them broke down, because when the family hears HIV, they hear death. So I had to make a trip back home the following Tuesday, so everyone could look at me and see I’m okay. I had to explain to them that the last time they saw me — in Christmas — I was HIV-positive, so nothing was different. And I showed everyone my medicine. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you kept it from any other family members? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:The only person I haven’t told in my family is my dad. I’m under the belief that my dad is having early onset dementia, so if I tell him, it will be the first time that he hears it because no other family member has told him. But his memory comes and goes. \\\\nIf my family is talking about it and they mention me, and he goes through one of those bouts where he doesn’t remember I told him, he’ll be hearing it again for the first time. I just don’t want to put him through that. \\\\nBut I told everyone else. I even told my sisters on my father’s side. They all know. They all love me the same. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Have you told friends outside your family? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:Yes. I actually told my best friend before I told my mom. Before I even started my medication, she knew. I told her as soon as I found out. She told me about a serious problem that was going on with her, and I decided I could trust her if I couldn’t trust anyone else. \\\\nI also told several other friends. I told my group in Alcoholics Anonymous, because I am a recovering addict. I disclosed to the entire group. \\\\nEverybody has treated me with nothing but respect. I’m just one of the fortunate ones, I would say. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:You haven’t had anyone with negative reactions? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:I haven’t had that yet. No one, not even when I got in a relationship. \\\\nI met someone online, and there were two things I wanted him to know. One, I’m transgender. Two, I’m HIV-positive. \\\\nI gave him the option to decide if he wanted to pursue a relationship and take the risk with me. That option was taken away from me when I was infected — and I wouldn’t do to him or anyone else what was done to me. \\\\nI tried to make the relationship work, but it just didn’t work out. I was in a completely different place mentally than he was. \\\\nBut I’ve met nothing but positive reactions. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Is that the only relationship you’ve been in since you found out? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:Yes. That’s the only personal or dating relationship. After I found out, I just completely shut down as far as relationships. I had to learn what it was like to live positively, and I really wanted to get to me. \\\\nI almost didn’t even give this last relationship a chance, because I was in that same head space in which I worry enough about my health, and I don’t want to worry about if we were safe enough. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you still feel that way? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:Right now, it just hasn’t come up. There is only one person that I’m actually talking and texting to. I met this person when I was in DC, and we’ve only been talking and texting. I haven’t actually been with him, and I don’t know that I ever will. \\\\nI just don’t want to feel like someone wants to take care of me. I’m independent. I’m not disabled. I hate that people would make me feel dependent. \\\\nI have no want. All of my needs are met, but I have no want. I don’t want for anything. That’s what I’m trying to get people to see. \\\\nIf nothing else comes from this, I get to be the opportunity to be the voice for those who feel they can’t talk about it or feel like they’ve lost hope. I hope they say, \"Well, if Tommy did it, I can do it.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:How about your community, like church? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:I do go to church. There’s only one reason I haven’t told my church: my former roommate introduced me to the church, and I haven’t told him because he’s a blabbermouth. Any little thing I did when we lived together, he told all sorts of people, even if I told him it was just between us. \\\\nLike when I told him I was starting hormone therapy, he told his friends. They were like, \"Why doesn’t Tommy just get a breast implant?\" First of all, it’s none of your business. Second of all, it’s not what I choose. Third of all, how dare you go out and tell people? \\\\nI don’t think he means anything by it. I don’t think he’s doing it in a malicious manner. I just think that’s who he is, and I’ve come to accept him and love him for who he is. \\\\nBut when I’m ready to tell my church, I will do it. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you think your church would be accepting of it? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:I really do. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:One thing I’ve heard about is that people were scared to come out as HIV-positive, yet when they came out, it turned out to be not be so bad. It sounds like that was your experience. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:Yeah, yeah. I had only told my best friend and my mom. Up until February 2014, I hadn’t told anyone else. I was diagnosed in December 2012, so it was over a year until I let anyone else in. \\\\nBut now, I’m in an entirely different place mentally and spiritually. Whether it’s accepted or not, I’m okay. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nGerman Lopez:Do you regret not telling people earlier? \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nTommy Luckett:Yes. I felt so bad. I felt really bad not telling my family earlier. That’s why I made the trip back home and stayed there for two days so they could see me. \\\\nI deeply regret not telling my family and the friends I have told, because I’ve been met with the same reaction. They’ll cry, but they’ll see I’m okay. But they may think how long I’ve gone through it by myself, and that makes me sad. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"One time, walking back to my dorm, I was called \"the HIV girl\" by a group of guys.\" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nBack to top \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nEditor: Eleanor Barkhorn \\\\nDesigner: Adam Baumgartner \\\\nDeveloper: Nicole Zhu \\\\nSpecial thanks: Uy Tieu, Tyson Whiting, Jon Douglas, Chao Li, and Mike Case \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n:  1  \n",
